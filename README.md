# abundance-tsne

This repo contains the code related to the paper ["Dissecting stellar chemical abundance space with t-SNE" (Anders et al. 2018, Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics 619, A125)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...619A.125A/abstract).

The data used is stored in ./data, the results of different t-SNE runs can be found in ./tsne_results, the figures are in ./im. 
The code used to create the figures (including the Bensby+2014 sample) is in ./python (migrated to python 3). The original python 2.7 code is in the *.py.bak files.
