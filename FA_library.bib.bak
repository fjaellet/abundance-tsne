  Abstract                 = {{The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) has been
in operation since July 2014. This paper describes the second data
release from this phase, and the fourteenth from SDSS overall (making
this, Data Release Fourteen or DR14). This release makes public data
taken by SDSS-IV in its first two years of operation (July 2014--2016).
Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14 is cumulative, including the most
recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS since the
first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14 is the first public
release of data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Sky Survey (eBOSS);
the first data from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory
(APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2), including stellar
parameter estimates from an innovative data driven machine learning
algorithm known as The Cannon; and almost twice as many data cubes from
the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the
previous release (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location
and format of the publicly available data from SDSS-IV surveys. We
provide references to the important technical papers describing how
these data have been taken (both targeting and observation details) and
processed for scientific use. The SDSS website (www.sdss.org) has been
updated for this release, and provides links to data downloads, as well
as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is planning to continue
to collect astronomical data until 2020.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. We performed a uniform and detailed abundance analysis of 12
refractory elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Co, Sc, Mn, and V)
for a sample of 1111 FGK dwarf stars from the HARPS GTO planet search
program. Of these stars, 109 are known to harbor giant planetary
companions and 26 stars are exclusively hosting Neptunians and
super-Earths. <BR /> Aims: The two main goals of this paper are to
investigate whether there are any differences between the elemental
abundance trends for stars of different stellar populations and to
characterize the planet host and non-host samples in terms of their
[X/H]. The extensive study of this sample, focused on the abundance
differences between stars with and without planets will be presented in
a parallel paper. <BR /> Methods: The equivalent widths of spectral
lines were automatically measured from HARPS spectra with the ARES code.
The abundances of the chemical elements were determined using an LTE
abundance analysis relative to the Sun, with the 2010 revised version of
the spectral synthesis code MOOG and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9
atmospheres. To separate the Galactic stellar populations we applied
both a purely kinematical approach and a chemical method. <BR />
Results: We found that the chemically separated (based on the Mg, Si,
and Ti abundances) thin- and thick disks are also chemically disjunct
for Al, Sc, Co, and Ca. Some bifurcation might also exist for Na, V, Ni,
and Mn, but there is no clear boundary of their [X/Fe] ratios. We
confirm that an overabundance in giant-planet host stars is clear for
all studied elements.We also confirm that stars hosting only
Neptunian-like planets may be easier to detect around stars with similar
metallicities than around non-planet hosts, although for some elements
(particulary {$\alpha$}-elements) the lower limit of [X/H] is very abrupt.

{$\mu$}m, and [N III] 57 {$\mu$}m lines toward 18 compact and ultracompact
(UC) H II regions. These data were combined with data from the
literature and high-resolution radio continuum maps to construct
detailed statistical equilibrium and ionization equilibrium models of 34
compact H II regions located at galactocentric distances (D$_{G}$)
0-12 kpc. Our models simultaneously fitted the observed IR
fine-structure lines and high-resolution radio continuum maps. Abundance
gradients are found of the form [S/H] = (-4.45 +/- 0.04) - (0.063 +/-
0.006) D$_{G}$ (kpc), [N/H] = (-3.58 +/- 0.04) - (0.072 +/- 0.006)
D$_{G}$ (kpc), and [O/H] = (-2.85 +/- 0.06) - (0.064 +/- 0.009)
D$_{G}$ (kpc), and we derive T$_{e}$ = (4560 +/- 220) + (390
+/- 40) D$_{G}$ (kpc). The T$_{e}$ gradient is consistent
with the T$_{e}$ gradient determined independently via radio
recombination lines (Afflerbach et al.). We observe no dependence of
S/O, N/O, or T$_{eff}$ on D$_{G}$. Gradients in
N$^{++}$/O$^{++}$ and O$^{++}$/S$^{++}$ are
observed in the sense of increasing ionization with increasing
D$_{G}$. This is entirely consistent with the decreased line
blanketing with increasing D$_{G}$ required by the above abundance
gradients. All three gradients are best fitted by a linear dependence on
D$_{G}$. The abundances are consistent with production of sulfur,
nitrogen, and oxygen by primary nucleosynthesis. Comparison with
abundances in other galaxies implies a Hubble type between Sab and Sb
for our Galaxy and an unbarred or mixed galactic structure (Vila-Costas
{\amp} Edmunds). Our derived T$_{eff}$ is 2000-10,000 K lower than
T$_{eff}$ expected from ZAMS stars of the same Lyman continuum
flux (Panagia; Vacca et al.), probably owing to uncertainties in the UV
flux of stellar models for E $\gt$= 35.1 eV, uncertainties in the
luminosity-T$_{eff}$ calibration, and/or ionization of H II
regions by multiple stars in some sources.

  Abstract                 = {{We study the formation of disc galaxies in a fully cosmological
framework using adaptive mesh refinement simulations. We perform an
extensive parameter study of the main subgrid processes that control how
gas is converted into stars and the coupled effect of supernovae
feedback. We argue that previous attempts to form disc galaxies have
been unsuccessful because of the universal adoption of strong feedback
combined with high star formation efficiencies. Unless extreme amounts
of energy are injected into the interstellar medium during supernovae
events, these star formation parameters result in bulge-dominated S0/Sa
galaxies as star formation is too efficient at z{\tilde} 3. We show that
a low efficiency of star formation more closely models the subparsec
physical processes, especially at high redshift. We highlight the
successful formation of extended disc galaxies with scalelengths
r$_{d}$= 4-5 kpc, flat rotation curves and bulge-to-disc ratios of
B/D {\tilde} 1/4. Not only do we resolve the formation of a Milky
Way-like spiral galaxy, we also observe the secular evolution of the
disc as it forms a pseudo-bulge. The disc properties agree well with
observations and are compatible with the photometric and baryonic
Tully-Fisher relations, the {$\Sigma$}$_{SFR}$-{$\Sigma$}$_{gas}$
(Kennicutt-Schmidt) relation and the observed angular momentum content
of spiral galaxies. We conclude that the underlying small-scale star
formation physics plays a greater role than previously considered in
simulations of galaxy formation.

current incarnation, SDSS-III. This data release includes the first
spectroscopic data from the Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution
Experiment (APOGEE), along with spectroscopic data from the Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) taken through 2012 July. The
APOGEE instrument is a near-infrared R \~{} 22,500 300 fiber spectrograph
covering 1.514-1.696 {$\mu$}m. The APOGEE survey is studying the chemical
abundances and radial velocities of roughly 100,000 red giant star
candidates in the bulge, bar, disk, and halo of the Milky Way. DR10
includes 178,397 spectra of 57,454 stars, each typically observed three
or more times, from APOGEE. Derived quantities from these spectra
(radial velocities, effective temperatures, surface gravities, and
metallicities) are also included. DR10 also roughly doubles the number
of BOSS spectra over those included in the Ninth Data Release. DR10
includes a total of 1,507,954 BOSS spectra comprising 927,844 galaxy
spectra, 182,009 quasar spectra, and 159,327 stellar spectra selected
over 6373.2 deg$^{2}$.

535,995 new galaxy spectra (median z \~{} 0.52), 102,100 new quasar spectra
(median z \~{} 2.32), and 90,897 new stellar spectra, along with the data
presented in previous data releases. These spectra were obtained with
the new BOSS spectrograph and were taken between 2009 December and 2011
July. In addition, the stellar parameters pipeline, which determines
radial velocities, surface temperatures, surface gravities, and
metallicities of stars, has been updated and refined with improvements
in temperature estimates for stars with T $_{eff}$ {\lt} 5000 K and
in metallicity estimates for stars with [Fe/H] {\gt} -0.5. DR9 includes
new stellar parameters for all stars presented in DR8, including stars
from SDSS-I and II, as well as those observed as part of the SEGUE-2.
The astrometry error introduced in the DR8 imaging catalogs has been
corrected in the DR9 data products. The next data release for SDSS-III
will be in Summer 2013, which will present the first data from the
APOGEE along with another year of data from BOSS, followed by the final
SDSS-III data release in 2014 December.

  Abstract                 = {{The third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) took
data from 2008 to 2014 using the original SDSS wide-field imager, the
original and an upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a
new near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical
interferometer. All of the data from SDSS-III are now made public. In
particular, this paper describes Data Release 11 (DR11) including all
data acquired through 2013 July, and Data Release 12 (DR12) adding data
acquired through 2014 July (including all data included in previous data
releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing. Relative to our
previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new spectra of
galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(BOSS) over an additional 3000 deg$^{2}$ of sky, more than triples
the number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point
Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes
repeated accurate radial velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the
Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS).
The APOGEE outputs now include the measured abundances of 15 different
elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added 5200 deg$^{2}$ of
ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of the Sloan
Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey;
2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and
247,216 stars over 9376 deg$^{2}$; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of
156,593 stars; and 197,040 MARVELS spectra of 5513 stars. Since its
first light in 1998, SDSS has imaged over 1/3 of the Celestial sphere in
five bands and obtained over five million astronomical spectra.

chemical abundance gradients of different stellar populations. From this

gradients with those derived from planetary nebulae (PNs) of types I,

the stars evolving toward the white dwarf stage produce PNs and that the
less massive stars are less likely to produce PNs. Other arguments
supporting the previous conclusions are presented.

  Abstract                 = {{The determination of photospheric abundances in late-type stars from
spectroscopic observations is a well-established field, built on solid
theoretical foundations. Improving those foundations to refine the
accuracy of the inferred abundances has proven challenging, but progress
has been made. In parallel, developments on instrumentation, chiefly
regarding multi-object spectroscopy, have been spectacular, and a number
of projects are collecting large numbers of observations for stars
across the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, promising important advances
in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. After providing
a brief description of the basic physics and input data involved in the
analysis of stellar spectra, a review is made of the analysis steps, and
the available tools to cope with large observational efforts. The paper
closes with a quick overview of relevant ongoing and planned
spectroscopic surveys, and highlights of recent research on photospheric
abundances.

the stars more luminous than M\_V = 6.5 mag within 14.5 pc from the Sun.
The Hipparcos catalog's completeness limits guarantee that our survey is
comprehensive and free from some of the selection effects in other
samples of nearby stars. The resulting spectroscopic database, which we
have made publicly available, includes spectra for 118 stars obtained
with a resolving power of R {\sime} 50 000, continuous spectral coverage
between {\tilde} 362-921 nm, and typical signal-to-noise ratios in the
range 150-600. We derive stellar parameters and perform a preliminary
abundance and kinematic analysis of the F-G-K stars in the sample. The
inferred metallicity ([Fe/H]) distribution is centered at about -0.1
dex, and shows a standard deviation of 0.2 dex. A comparison with larger
samples of Hipparcos stars, some of which have been part of previous
abundance studies, suggests that our limited sample is representative of
a larger volume of the local thin disk. We identify a number of
metal-rich K-type stars which appear to be very old, confirming the
claims for the existence of such stars in the solar neighborhood. With
atmospheric effective temperatures and gravities derived independently
of the spectra, we find that our classical LTE model-atmosphere analysis
of metal-rich (and mainly K-type) stars provides discrepant abundances
from neutral and ionized lines of several metals. This ionization
imbalance could be a sign of departures from LTE or inhomogeneous
structure, which are ignored in the interpretation of the spectra.
Alternatively, but seemingly unlikely, the mismatch could be explained
by systematic errors in the scale of effective temperatures. Based on
transitions of majority species, we discuss abundances of 16 chemical
elements. In agreement with earlier studies we find that the abundance
ratios to iron of Si, Sc, Ti, Co, and Zn become smaller as the iron
abundance increases until approaching the solar values, but the trends
reverse for higher iron abundances. At any given metallicity, stars with
a low galactic rotational velocity tend to have high abundances of Mg,
Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Co, Zn, and Eu, but low abundances of Ba, Ce, and Nd.
The Sun appears deficient by roughly 0.1 dex in O, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Y,
Ce, Nd, and Eu, compared to its immediate neighbors with similar iron
abundances.

Based on observations made with the 2.7 m telescope at the McDonald
Observatory of the University of Texas at Austin (Texas), and the 1.52 m
telescope at the European Southern Observatory (La Silla, Chile) under
the agreement with the CNPq/Observatorio Nacional (Brazil).

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: Previous studies have found that the Galactic rotation
velocity-metallicity (V-[Fe/H]) relations for the thin and thick disk
populations show negative and positive slopes, respectively. The first
Gaia data release includes the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS)
information, which we use to analyze the V-[Fe/H] relation for a
strictly selected sample with high enough astrometric accuracy. We aim
to present an explanation for the slopes of the V-[Fe/H] relationship.
<BR /> Methods: We have identified a sample of stars with accurate Gaia
TGAS data and SDSS APOGEE [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Fe/H] measurements. We
measured the V-[Fe/H] relation for thin and thick disk stars classified
on the basis of their [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Fe/H] abundances. <BR />
Results: We find dV/ d [Fe/H] = -18 {\plusmn} 2 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$ for stars in the thin disk and dV/ d [Fe/H] = +23
{\plusmn} 10 km s$^{-1}$ dex$^{-1}$ for thick disk stars, and
thus we confirm the different signs for the slopes. The negative value
of dV/d[Fe/H] for thin disk stars is consistent with previous work, but
the combination of TGAS and APOGEE data provides higher precision, even
though systematic errors could exceed {\plusmn}5 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$. Our average measurement of dV/d[Fe/H] for local thick
disk stars shows a somewhat flatter slope than in previous studies, but
we confirm a significant spread and a dependence of the slope on the
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratio of the stars. Using a simple N-body model, we
demonstrate that the observed trends for the thick and thin disk can be
explained by the measured radial metallicity gradients and the
correlation between orbital eccentricity and metallicity in the thick
disk. <BR /> Conclusions: We conclude that the V-[Fe/H] relation for
thin disk stars is well determined from our TGAS-APOGEE sample, and a
direct consequence of the radial metallicity gradient and the
correlation between Galactic rotation and mean Galactocentric distance.
Stars formed farther away from the solar circle tend to be near their
orbital pericenter, showing larger velocities and on average lower
metallicities, while those closer to the Galactic center are usually
closer to their orbital apocenter, therefore moving slower and with
higher metallicities. The positive dV/d[Fe/H] for the thick disk sample
is likely connected to the correlation between orbital eccentricity and
metallicity for that population.

nearby field stars in the colour-magnitude diagram with very high
accuracy. These positions can be compared with the predictions of
stellar evolutionary calculations to provide information on the basic
parameters of the stars: masses, radii, effective temperatures, ages,
and chemical composition. The degeneracy between mass, age, and
metallicity is not so large as to prevent a reliable estimate of masses,
radii and effective temperatures, at least for stars of solar
metallicity. The evolutionary models of Bertelli et al. (1994) predict
those parameters finely, and furthermore, the applied transformation
from the theoretical (log g- T\_eff) to the observational (M\_v-B-V) plane
is precise enough to derive radii with an uncertainty of \~{} 6\%, masses
within 8\%, and T\_effs within \~{} 2\% for a certain range of the stellar
parameters. This is demonstrated by means of comparison with the
measurements in eclipsing binaries and the InfraRed Flux Method. The
application of the interpolation procedure in the theoretical isochrones
to the stars within 100 pc from the Sun observed with Hipparcos provides
estimates for 17,219 stars. Table\~{}1 is only available in electronic form

Normal M-giants colours are well reproduced, reaching a high
quantitative agreement with observations for spectral types earlier than
M7. The out-of-phase variations of the various spectral features of
Miras are also acceptably reproduced, despite limitations in the
modelling. This enables us to confirm that the phase lag phenomenon
results from the propagation of perturbations in the extended

  Abstract                 = {{A number of problems in probability and statistics can be addressed
using the multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution. In the
one-dimensional case, computing the probability for a given mean and
variance simply requires the evaluation of the corresponding Gaussian
density. In the $n$-dimensional setting, however, it requires the
inversion of an $n \times n$ covariance matrix, $C$, as well as the
evaluation of its determinant, $\det(C)$. In many cases, such as
regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of the
form $C = \sigma^2 I + K$, where $K$ is computed using a specified
covariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters
(hyperparameters). The matrix $C$ is typically dense, causing standard
direct methods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require
$\mathcal O(n^3)$ work. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale
modeling. Here, we show that for the most commonly used covariance
functions, the matrix $C$ can be hierarchically factored into a product
of block low-rank updates of the identity matrix, yielding an $\mathcal
O (n\log^2 n) $ algorithm for inversion. More importantly, we show that
this factorization enables the evaluation of the determinant $\det(C)$,
permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in high dimensions
under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining $K$. Our fast
algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of
hyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The
combination of nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with
high-performance computing resources will permit the modeling of
previously intractable problems. We illustrate the performance of the
scheme on standard covariance kernels.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Galactic structure studies can be used as a path to constrain
the scenario of formation and evolution of our Galaxy. The dependence
with the age of stellar population parameters would be linked with the
history of star formation and dynamical evolution. Aims. We aim to
investigate the structures of the outer Galaxy, such as the scale
length, disc truncation, warp and flare of the thin disc and study their
dependence with age by using 2MASS data and a population synthesis model
(the so-called Besan$\backslash$c$\{$c$\}$on Galaxy Model). Methods. We have used a
genetic algorithm to adjust the parameters on the observed
colour-magnitude diagrams at longitudes 80 deg $\lt$= l $\lt$= 280 deg for
|b| $\lt$= 5.5 deg. We explored parameter degeneracies and uncertainties.
Results. We identify a clear dependence of the thin disc scale length,
warp and flare shapes with age. The scale length is found to vary
between 3.8 kpc for the youngest to about 2 kpc for the oldest. The warp
shows a complex structure, clearly asymmetrical with a node angle
changing with age from approximately 165 deg for old stars to 195 deg
for young stars. The outer disc is also flaring with a scale height that
varies by a factor of two between the solar neighbourhood and a
Galactocentric distance of 12 kpc. Conclusions. We conclude that the
thin disc scale length is in good agreement with the inside-out
formation scenario and that the outer disc is not in dynamical
equilibrium. The warp deformation with time may provide some clues to
its origin.

  Abstract                 = {{Using combined asteroseismic and spectroscopic observations of 418
red-giant stars close to the Galactic disc plane (6 kpc $\lt$
R$_{Gal}$ {\lsim} 13 kpc, | Z$_{Gal}$| $\lt$ 0.3 kpc), we
measure the age dependence of the radial metallicity distribution in the
Milky Way's thin disc over cosmic time. The slope of the radial iron
gradient of the young red-giant population (-0.058 {\plusmn} 0.008
[stat.] {\plusmn}0.003 [syst.] dex/kpc) is consistent with recent Cepheid
measurements. For stellar populations with ages of 1-4 Gyr the gradient
is slightly steeper, at a value of -0.066 {\plusmn} 0.007 {\plusmn} 0.002
dex/kpc, and then flattens again to reach a value of -0.03 dex/kpc for
stars with ages between 6 and 10 Gyr. Our results are in good agreement
with a state-of-the-art chemo-dynamical Milky-Way model in which the
evolution of the abundance gradient and its scatter can be entirely
explained by a non-varying negative metallicity gradient in the
interstellar medium, together with stellar radial heating and migration.
We also offer an explanation for why intermediate-age open clusters in
the solar neighbourhood can be more metal-rich, and why their radial
metallicity gradient seems to be much steeper than that of the youngest
clusters. Already within 2 Gyr, radial mixing can bring metal-rich
clusters from the innermost regions of the disc to Galactocentric radii
of 5 to 8 kpc. We suggest that these outward-migrating clusters may be
less prone to tidal disruption and therefore steepen the local
intermediate-age cluster metallicity gradient. Our scenario also
explains why the strong steepening of the local iron gradient with age
is not seen in field stars. In the near future, asteroseismic data from
the K2 mission will allow for improved statistics and a better coverage
of the inner-disc regions, thereby providing tighter constraints on
theevolution of the central parts of the Milky Way.

  Abstract                 = {{With the advent of the space missions CoRoT and Kepler, it has become
feasible to determine precise asteroseismic masses and ages for large
samples of red-giant stars. In this paper, we present the CoRoGEE
dataset -- obtained from CoRoT lightcurves for 606 red giant stars in
two fields of the Galactic disc which have been co-observed for an
ancillary project of APOGEE. We have used the Bayesian parameter
estimation code PARAM to calculate distances, extinctions, masses, and
ages for these stars in a homogeneous analysis, resulting in relative
statistical uncertainties of $\sim2\\%$ in distance, $\sim4\\%$ in radius,
$\sim9\\%$ in mass and $\sim25\\%$ in age. We also assess systematic age
uncertainties due to different input physics and mass loss. We discuss
the correlation between ages and chemical abundance patterns of field
stars over a large radial range of the Milky Way's disc (5 kpc
$\ltR\_{\rm Gal}\lt$ 14 kpc), focussing on the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]-age
plane in five radial bins of the Galactic disc. We find an overall
agreement with the expectations of chemical-evolution models computed
before the present data were available, especially for the outer
regions. However, our data also indicate that a significant fraction of
stars now observed near and beyond the Solar Neighbourhood migrated from
inner regions. Mock CoRoGEE observations of a chemo-dynamical Milky Way
disc model show that the number of high-metallicity stars in the outer
disc is too high to be accounted for even by the strong radial mixing
present in the model. The mock observations also reveal that the age
distribution of the [$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced sequence in the CoRoGEE
inner-disc field is much broader than expected from a combination of
radial mixing and observational errors. We suggest that a thick
disc/bulge component that formed stars for more than 3 Gyr may account
for these discrepancies.

  Abstract                 = {{This paper reports on the spectroscopic investigation of 12 Cepheids
which are situated in the crucial region of galactocentric distances
from 9 kpc to 12 kpc, where according to our previous results
(Andrievsky et al. $\backslash$cite$\{$andret02c$\}$; Luck et al. $\backslash$cite$\{$lucket03$\}$) the
radial metallicity distribution experiences an obvious change. In
particular, the wriggle in the iron abundance distribution is found to
fall approximately at galactocentric distances 10-11 kpc (assuming
galactocentric distance of the Sun R$_{G}$, {\sun} = 7.9 kpc).
Within the transition zone from 10 to 11 kpc the relative-to-solar iron
abundance decreases approximately to -0.2 dex. The new sample of stars,
analyzed in present paper, gives results supporting the previous
conclusion about the multimodal character of the metallicity
distribution in galactic disc. Using a quite simple consideration of
galactic chemical evolution we show that the observed distribution can
be explained in the framework of a model which includes the spiral arms.
In particular, the wriggle feature associated with R$_{G}$ {\ap} 11
kpc can be interpreted as a change of metallicity level in the vicinity
of the galactic corotation resonance.

Based on spectra collected at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.

Experiment (RAVE) survey in and beyond the solar neighbourhood. We
detect significant overdensities in the velocity distributions using a
technique based on the wavelet transform. We find that the main local
kinematic groups are large-scale features, surviving at least up to
{\tilde}1 kpc from the Sun in the direction of antirotation, and also at
? below the Galactic plane. We also find that for regions located at
different radii than the Sun, the known groups appear shifted in the
v$_{R}$-v$_{phi}$ velocity plane. For example, the
Hercules group has a larger azimuthal velocity for regions inside the
solar circle and a lower value outside. We have also discovered a new
group at ? in the solar neighbourhood and confirmed the significance of
other previously found groups. Some of these trends detected for the
first time are consistent with dynamical models of the effects of the
bar and the spiral arms. More modelling is required to definitively
characterize the non-axisymmetric components of our Galaxy using these
groups.

find clear asymmetries in the $\{$$\{$v$\}$$_{R}$$\}$ - $\{$$\{$v$\}$$_{phi
}$$\}$ velocity distributions of thin and thick disk stars: there are
more stars moving radially outward for low azimuthal velocities and more
radially inward for high azimuthal velocities. Such asymmetries have
been previously reported for the thin disk as being due to the Galactic
bar, but this is the first time that the same type of structures are
seen in the thick disk. Our findings imply that the velocities of
thick-disk stars should no longer be described by Schwarzschild{\rsquo}s,
multivariate Gaussian or purely axisymmetric distributions. Furthermore,
the nature of previously reported substructures in the thick disk needs
to be revisited as these could be associated with dynamical resonances
rather than to accretion events. It is clear that dynamical models of
the Galaxy must fit the 3D velocity distributions of the disks, rather
than the projected 1D, if we are to understand the Galaxy fully.

from high-resolution spectroscopy. Five are selected from the SDSS SEGUE
sample of metal-poor stars. Another star chosen from the SDSS SEGUE
sample has only a weak upper limit on its carbon abundance obtained from
the high-resolution spectrum. The effective temperatures are all higher
than 6000 K, while the metallicities, parameterized by [ Fe/H ] , are
all below -2 the star with the lowest iron abundance has [ Fe/H ]
= - 3.1. Six of our objects exhibit high abundance ratios of
barium ([ Ba/Fe ] $\gt$ + 1), suggesting large contributions of the
products of former AGB companions via mass transfer across binary
systems. One star (SDSS 1707+58) exhibits rapid variation in radial
velocity, a strong signature that it belongs to a close binary.
Combining our results with previous studies provides a total of 20 CEMP
main-sequence turnoff stars for which the abundances of carbon and at
least some neutron-capture elements are determined. The [ C/H ] ratios
for this sample of CEMP turnoff stars are generally higher than those of
CEMP giants and their dispersion is also smaller. These results indicate
that the carbon-enhanced material from the companion AGB star is
preserved at the surface of turnoff stars with no significant dilution,
counter to expectations if processes such as thermohaline mixing have
operated in unevolved CEMP stars. In contrast to the behavior of [ C/H ]
, a large dispersion in the observed [ Ba/H ] is found for the CEMP
turnoff stars, suggesting that the efficiency of the s-process in very
metal-poor AGB stars may differ greatly from star to star. Four of the
six stars from the sample exhibit kinematics associated with membership
in the outer-halo population, a remarkably high fraction.

Catalogue content in order to detect anomalies and individual problems
in specific objects or in overall statistical properties, and either to
filter them before the public release or to describe the different
caveats on the release for an optimal exploitation of the data. <BR />
Methods: Dedicated methods using either Gaia internal data, external
catalogues, or models have been developed for the validation processes.
They test normal stars as well as various populations such as open or
globular clusters, double stars, variable stars, and quasars. Properties
of coverage, accuracy, and precision of the data are provided by the
numerous tests presented here and are jointly analysed to assess the
data release content. <BR /> Results: This independent validation
confirms the quality of the published data, Gaia DR1 being the most
precise all-sky astrometric and photometric catalogue to date. However,
several limitations in terms of completeness, and astrometric or
photometric quality are identified and described. Figures describing the
relevant properties of the release are shown, and the testing activities
carried out validating the user interfaces are also described. A
particular emphasis is made on the statistical use of the data in
scientific exploitation.

understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun
and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard
against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are
compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the
solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a
redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements,
using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent
hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully
considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and
accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)
whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous
compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy
findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared
to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical
composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency
between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values
obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine
meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of
the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has
yet to find a satisfactory resolution.

  Abstract                 = {{Estimating a distance by inverting a parallax is only valid in the
absence of noise. As most stars in the Gaia catalog will have
non-negligible fractional parallax errors, we must treat distance
estimation as a constrained inference problem. Here we investigate the
performance of various priors for estimating distances, using a
simulated Gaia catalog of one billion stars. We use three minimalist,
isotropic priors, as well an anisotropic prior derived from the
observability of stars in a Milky Way model. The two priors that assume
a uniform distribution of stars{\mdash}either in distance or in space
density{\mdash}give poor results: The root mean square fractional
distance error, $\{$f$\}$$_{{rms}$$\}$, grows far in excess of 100\% once
the fractional parallax error, $\{$f$\}$$_{{true}$$\}$, is larger than 0.1.
A prior assuming an exponentially decreasing space density with
increasing distance performs well once its single parameter{\mdash}the
scale length{\mdash} has been set to an appropriate value:
$\{$f$\}$$_{{rms}$$\}$ is roughly equal to $\{$f$\}$$_{{true}$$\}$ for
$\{$f$\}$$_{{true}$$\}$$\backslash$lt 0.4, yet does not increase further as
$\{$f$\}$$_{{true}$$\}$ increases up to to 1.0. The Milky Way prior
performs well except toward the Galactic center, due to a mismatch with
the (simulated) data. Such mismatches will be inevitable (and remain
unknown) in real applications, and can produce large errors. We
therefore suggest adopting the simpler exponentially decreasing space
density prior, which is also less time-consuming to compute. Including
Gaia photometry improves the distance estimation significantly for both
the Milky Way and exponentially decreasing space density prior, yet
doing so requires additional assumptions about the physical nature of
stars.

We do this with two distance priors: A minimalist, isotropic prior
assuming an exponentially decreasing space density with increasing
distance, and an anisotropic prior derived from the observability of
stars in a Milky Way model. We validate our results by comparing our
distance estimates for 105 Cepheids which have more precise,
independently estimated distances. For this sample we find that the
Milky Way prior performs better (the rms of the scaled residuals is
0.40) than the exponentially decreasing space density prior (rms is
0.57), although for distances beyond 2 kpc the Milky Way prior performs
worse, with a bias in the scaled residuals of -0.36 (versus
-0.07 for the exponentially decreasing space density prior). We do
not attempt to include the photometric data in GDR1 due to the lack of
reliable color information. Our distance catalog is available at <A href=''http://www.mpia.de/homes/calj/tgas\_distances/main.html''>http://www.mpia.de/homes/calj/tgas\_distances/main.html</A>

distances. Combining data or testing models should be done with the
original parallaxes, and attention paid to correlated and systematic
uncertainties.

neighbourhood. We rederive the solar motion and the structure of the
local velocity ellipsoids. When the principal velocity dispersions are
assumed to increase with time as t$^{beta}$, the index {$\beta$} is
larger for {$\sigma$}$_{W}$ ({$\beta$}$_{W}$ \~{} 0.45) than for
{$\sigma$}$_{U}$ ({$\beta$}$_{U}$ \~{} 0.31). For the
three-dimensional velocity dispersion, we obtain {$\beta$} = 0.35. We
exclude saturation of disc heating after \~{}3Gyr as proposed by Quillen
{\amp} Garnett. Saturation after {\gt}\~{}4Gyr combined with an abrupt
increase in velocity dispersion for the oldest stars cannot be excluded.
For all our models, the star formation rate (SFR) is declining, being a
factor of 2-7 lower now than it was at the beginning. Models in which
the SFR declines exponentially favour very high disc ages between 11.5
and 13Gyr and exclude ages below \~{}10.5Gyr as they yield worse fits to
the number density and velocity dispersion of red stars. Models in which
the SFR is the sum of two declining exponentials representing the thin
and thick discs favour ages between 10.5 and 12Gyr with a lower limit of
\~{}10.0Gyr. Although in our models the SFR peaked surprisingly early, the
mean formation time of solar-neighbourhood stars is later than in ab
initio models of galaxy formation, probably on account of weaknesses in
such models.

the search for extrasolar planets. The mission is led by the CNES in
association with French laboratories and has a large international
participation. The European Space Agency (ESA), Austria, Belgium, and
Germany contribute to the payload, and Spain and Brazil contribute to
the ground segment. Development of the spacecraft, which is based on a
PROTEUS low earth orbit (LEO) recurrent platform, commenced in October
2000, and the satellite was launched on December 27, 2006. <BR />Aims:
The instrument and platform characteristics prior to launch have been
described in ESA publication (SP-1306). In the present paper we explain
the behaviour in flight, based on raw and corrected data. <BR
/>Methods: Five runs have been completed since January 2007. The data
used here are essentially those acquired during the commissioning phase
and from a long run that lasted 146 days. These enable us to give a
complete overview of the instrument and platform behaviour for all
environmental conditions. The ground based data processing is not
described in detail because the most important method has been published
elsewhere. <BR />Results: We show that the performance specifications
are easily satisfied when the environmental conditions are favourable.
Most of the perturbations, hence data corrections, are related to LEO
perturbations: high energy particles inside the South Atlantic Anomaly
(SAA), eclipses and temperature variations, and line of sight
fluctuations due to the attitude control system. Straylight due to the
reflected light from the earth, which is controlled by the telescope and
baffle design, appears to be negligible.

The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27th 2006, has been
developed and is operated by CNES, with contributions from Austria,
Belgium, Brazil, ESA, Germany and Spain.

Four French laboratories associated with the CNRS (LESIA, LAM, IAS, OMP)
collaborate with CNES on the satellite development. The authors are
grateful to Ian Roxburgh for a careful reading of the manuscript.

  Abstract                 = {{Stars which pass close to the Sun can perturb the Oort cloud, injecting
comets into the inner solar system where they may collide with the
Earth. Using van Leeuwen's re-reduction of the Hipparcos data
complemented by the original Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues, along
with recent radial velocity surveys, I integrate the orbits of over 50
000 stars through the Galaxy to look for close encounters. The search
uses a Monte Carlo sampling of the covariance of the data in order to
properly characterize the uncertainties in the times, distances, and
speeds of the encounters. I show that modelling stellar encounters by
assuming instead a linear relative motion produces, for many encounters,
inaccurate and biased results. I find 42, 14, and 4 stars which have
encounter distances below 2, 1, and 0.5 pc respectively, although some
of these stars have questionable data. Of the 14 stars coming within 1
pc, 5 were found by at least one of three previous studies (which found
a total of 7 coming within 1 pc). The closest encounter appears to be
<ASTROBJ>Hip 85605</ASTROBJ>, a K or M star, which has a 90\% probability
of coming between 0.04 and 0.20 pc between 240 and 470 kyr from now (90\%
Bayesian confidence interval). However, its astrometry may be incorrect,
in which case the closest encounter found is the K7 dwarf <ASTROBJ>GL
710</ASTROBJ>, which has a 90\% probability of coming within 0.10-0.44 pc
in about 1.3 Myr. A larger perturbation may have been caused by
<ASTROBJ>gamma Microscopii</ASTROBJ>, a G6 giant with a mass of about
2.5 M$_{&sun;}$, which came within 0.35-1.34 pc (90\% confidence
interval) around 3.8 Myr ago.

hundreds of millions of stars. Yet they will not measure a single

didactic article, I show that doing this is not trivial once the
fractional parallax error is larger than about 20\%, which will be the
case for about 80\% of stars in the Gaia catalog. Estimating distances is
an inference problem in which the use of prior assumptions is
unavoidable. I investigate the properties and performance of various
priors and examine their implications. A supposed uninformative uniform
prior in distance is shown to give very poor distance estimates (large
bias and variance). Any prior with a sharp cut-off at some distance has
similar problems. The choice of prior depends on the information one has
available{\mdash}and is willing to use{\mdash}concerning, e.g., the survey
and the Galaxy. I demonstrate that a simple prior which decreases
asymptotically to zero at infinite distance has good performance,
accommodates nonpositive parallaxes, and does not require a bias
correction.

  Abstract                 = {{I introduce a general, Bayesian method for modelling univariate time
series data assumed to be drawn from a continuous, stochastic process.
The method accommodates arbitrary temporal sampling, and takes into
account measurement uncertainties for arbitrary error models (not just
Gaussian) on both the time and signal variables. Any model for the
deterministic component of the variation of the signal with time is
supported, as is any model of the stochastic component on the signal and
time variables. Models illustrated here are constant and sinusoidal
models for the signal mean combined with a Gaussian stochastic
component, as well as a purely stochastic model, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process. The posterior probability distribution over model parameters is
determined via Monte Carlo sampling. Models are compared using the
''cross-validation likelihood'', in which the posterior-averaged
likelihood for different partitions of the data are combined. In
principle this is more robust to changes in the prior than is the
evidence (the prior-averaged likelihood). The method is demonstrated by
applying it to the light curves of 11 ultra cool dwarf stars, claimed by
a previous study to show statistically significant variability. This is
reassessed here by calculating the cross-validation likelihood for
various time series models, including a null hypothesis of no
variability beyond the error bars. 10 of 11 light curves are confirmed
as being significantly variable, and one of these seems to be periodic,
with two plausible periods identified. Another object is best described
by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a conclusion which is obviously
limited to the set of models actually tested.

  Abstract                 = {{Astrometric surveys provide the opportunity to measure the absolute
magnitudes of large numbers of stars, but only if the individual
line-of-sight extinctions are known. Unfortunately, extinction is highly
degenerate with stellar effective temperature when estimated from
broad-band optical/infrared photometry. To address this problem, I
introduce a Bayesian method for estimating the intrinsic parameters of a
star and its line-of-sight extinction. It uses both photometry and
parallaxes in a self-consistent manner in order to provide a
non-parametric posterior probability distribution over the parameters.
The method makes explicit use of domain knowledge by employing the
Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) to constrain solutions and to ensure
that they respect stellar physics. I first demonstrate this method by
using it to estimate effective temperature and extinction from BVJHK
data for a set of artificially reddened Hipparcos stars, for which
accurate effective temperatures have been estimated from high-resolution
spectroscopy. Using just the four colours, we see the expected strong
degeneracy (positive correlation) between the temperature and
extinction. Introducing the parallax, apparent magnitude and the HRD
reduces this degeneracy and improves both the precision (reduces the
error bars) and the accuracy of the parameter estimates, the latter by
about 35 per cent. The resulting accuracy is about 200 K in temperature
and 0.2 mag in extinction. I then apply the method to estimate these
parameters and absolute magnitudes for some 47 000 F, G, K Hipparcos
stars which have been cross-matched with Two-Micron All-Sky Survey
(2MASS). The method can easily be extended to incorporate the estimation
of other parameters, in particular metallicity and surface gravity,
making it particularly suitable for the analysis of the 10$^{9}$
stars from Gaia.

magnitude, obtaining astrometry, photometry, and low resolution
spectrophotometry on one billion astronomical sources, plus radial
velocities for over one hundred million stars. Itsmain objective is to
take a census of the stellar content of our Galaxy, with the goal of
revealing its formation and evolution. Gaia's unique feature is the
measurement of parallaxes and proper motions with hitherto unparalleled
accuracy for many objects. As a survey, the physical properties of most
of these objects are unknown. Here we describe the data analysis system
put together by the Gaia consortium to classify these objects and to
infer their astrophysical properties using the satellite's data. This
system covers single stars, (unresolved) binary stars, quasars, and
galaxies, all covering a wide parameter space. Multiple methods are used
for many types of stars, producing multiple results for the end user
according to different models and assumptions. Prior to its application
to real Gaia data the accuracy of these methods cannot be assessed
definitively. But as an example of the current performance, we can
attain internal accuracies (rms residuals) on F, G, K, M dwarfs and
giants at G = 15 (V = 15-17) for a wide range of metallicites and
interstellar extinctions of around 100 K in effective temperature
(T$_{eff}$), 0.1 mag in extinction (A$_{0}$), 0.2 dex in
metallicity ([Fe/H]), and 0.25 dex in surface gravity (log g). The
accuracy is a strong function of the parameters themselves, varying by a
factor of more than two up or down over this parameter range. After its
launch in December 2013, Gaia will nominally observe for five years,
during which the system we describe will continue to evolve in light of
experience with the real data.

about galaxy formation and evolution. H II regions are the most luminous
objects in the Milky Way at mid-infrared to radio wavelengths and can be
seen across the entire Galactic disk. We used the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Green Bank Telescope to measure radio
recombination line and continuum emission in 81 Galactic H II regions.
We calculated LTE electron temperatures using these data. In thermal
equilibrium metal abundances are expected to set the nebular electron
temperature with high abundances producing low temperatures. Our H II
region distribution covers a large range of Galactocentric radius (5-22
kpc) and samples the Galactic azimuth range 330{\deg}-60{\deg}. Using our
highest quality data (72 objects) we derived an O/H Galactocentric
radial gradient of -0.0383 {\plusmn} 0.0074 dex kpc$^{-1}$.
Combining these data with a similar survey made with the NRAO 140 Foot
telescope we get a radial gradient of -0.0446 {\plusmn} 0.0049 dex
kpc$^{-1}$ for this larger sample of 133 nebulae. The data are
well fit by a linear model and no discontinuities are detected. Dividing
our sample into three Galactic azimuth regions produced significantly
different radial gradients that range from -0.03 to -0.07 dex
kpc$^{-1}$. These inhomogeneities suggest that metals are not well
mixed at a given radius. We stress the importance of homogeneous samples
to reduce the confusion of comparing data sets with different
systematics. Galactic chemical evolution models typically derive
chemical evolution along only the radial dimension with time. Future
models should consider azimuthal evolution as well.

the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. H ii region abundances are
the result of billions of years of chemical evolution. We made radio
recombination line and continuum measurements of 21 H ii regions located
between Galactic azimuth Az = 90{\deg}-130{\deg}, a previously
unexplored region. We derive the plasma electron temperatures using the
line-to-continuum ratios and use them as proxies for the nebular [O/H]
abundances, because in thermal equilibrium the abundance of the coolants
(O, N, and other heavy elements) in the ionized gas sets the electron
temperature, with high abundances producing low temperatures. Combining
these data with our previous work produces a sample of 90 H ii regions
with high-quality electron temperature determinations. We derive
kinematic distances in a self-consistent way for the entire sample. The
radial gradient in [O/H] is -0.082+/- 0.014 $\{$dex$\}$ $\{$$\{$kpc$\}$$\}$$^{-1}$
for Az = 90{\deg}-130{\deg}, about a factor of 2 higher than the
average value between Az = 0{\deg}-60{\deg}. Monte Carlo simulations
show that the azimuthal structure we reported for Az =
0{\deg}-60{\deg} is not significant because kinematic distance
uncertainties can be as high as 50\% in this region. Nonetheless, the
flatter radial gradients between Az = 0{\deg}-60{\deg} compared with
Az = 90{\deg}-130{\deg} are significant within the uncertainty. We
suggest that this may be due to radial mixing from the Galactic Bar
whose major axis is aligned toward Az {\tilde} 30{\deg}.

similar metallicity of [Fe/H] {\ap} -1.3. We also obtained a reddening
E(B-V)=0.42{\plusmn}0.03 for NGC 6642, and a distance from the Sun of
d$_{&sun;}$=7.2{\plusmn}0.5 kpc. Therefore NGC 6642 is a moderately
metal-poor globular cluster that is spatially located in the bulge at a
galactocentric distance of R\_GC{\ap} 1.7 kpc. The comparison of CMDs of
NGC 6642 with those of M 5 shows that there is a very good match of
magnitude difference between turn-off and horizontal branch, suggesting
comparable ages. The age of M 5 is typical of halo globulars, so NGC
6642 is coeval with the halo. It is a good candidate as one of the few
genuine metal-poor and old bulge clusters, and might be one of the
oldest fossils in the Galaxy.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. The [Sr/Ba] and [Y/Ba] scatter observed in some galactic halo
stars that are very metal-poor and in a few individual stars of the
oldest known Milky Way globular cluster NGC 6522 have been interpreted
as evidence of early enrichment by massive fast-rotating stars
(spinstars). Because NGC 6522 is a bulge globular cluster, the
suggestion was that not only the very-metal poor halo stars, but also
bulge stars at [Fe/H] \~{} -1 could be used as probes of the stellar
nucleosynthesis signatures from the earlier generations of massive
stars, but at much higher metallicity. For the bulge the suggestions
were based on early spectra available for stars in NGC 6522, with a
medium resolution of R \~{} 22 000 and a moderate signal-to-noise ratio.
<BR /> Aims: The main purpose of this study is to re-analyse the NGC
6522 stars reported previously by using new high-resolution (R \~{} 45 000)
and high signal-to-noise spectra (S/N {\gt} 100). We aim at re-deriving
their stellar parameters and elemental ratios, in particular the
abundances of the neutron-capture s-process-dominated elements such as
Sr, Y, Zr, La, and Ba, and of the r-element Eu. <BR /> Methods:
High-resolution spectra of four giants belonging to the bulge globular
cluster NGC 6522 were obtained at the 8m VLT UT2-Kueyen telescope with
the UVES spectrograph in FLAMES-UVES configuration. The spectroscopic
parameters were derived based on the excitation and ionization
equilibrium of Fe i and Fe ii. <BR /> Results: Our analysis confirms a
metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.95 {\plusmn} 0.15 for NGC 6522 and the
overabundance of the studied stars in Eu (with +0.2 {\lt} [Eu/Fe] {\lt} +
0.4) and alpha-elements O and Mg. The neutron-capture
s-element-dominated Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, and La now show less pronounced
variations from star to star. Enhancements are in the range 0.0 {\lt}
[Sr/Fe] {\lt} +0.4, +0.23 {\lt} [Y/Fe] {\lt} +0.43, 0.0 {\lt} [Zr/Fe] {\lt}
+0.4, 0.0 {\lt} [La/Fe] {\lt} +0.35, and 0.05 {\lt} [Ba/Fe] {\lt} +0.55. <BR
/> Conclusions: The very high overabundances of [Y/Fe] previously
reported for the four studied stars is not confirmed with the new
high-quality spectra. The moderate enhancement in [Sr/Fe] previously
reported for one of the re-studied stars is confirmed, but the strong
enhancements of this ratio for the other two stars are not confirmed.
Despite the moderate enhancements found for the neutron-capture
s-element-dominated species, none of the four stars studied here show
positive values for all [Sr/Ba], [Y/Ba] and [Zr/Ba] ratios. The
re-studied stars are now compatible not only with the interpretation
that the s-process enhancements in these very old stars are due to
spinstars, but also with alternative models such as mass transfer from
s-process-rich AGB stars. Note, however, that when our results are
interpreted in the context of more extended datasets from the
literature, the spinstar scenario still seems to be favoured.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Manganese is mainly produced in type II SNe during explosive
silicon burning, in incomplete Si-burning regions, and depends on
several nucleosynthesis environment conditions, such as mass cut between
the matter ejected and falling back onto the remnant, electron and
neutron excesses, mixing fallback, and explosion energy. Manganese is
also produced in type Ia SNe. <BR /> Aims: The aim of this work is the
study of abundances of the iron-peak element Mn in 56 bulge giants,
among which 13 are red clump stars. Four bulge fields along the minor
axis are inspected. The study of abundances of Mn-over-Fe as a function
of metallicity in the Galactic bulge may shed light on its production
mechanisms. <BR /> Methods: High-resolution spectra were obtained using
the FLAMES+UVES spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope. The spectra
were obtained within a program to observe 800 stars using the GIRAFFE
spectrograph, together with the present UVES spectra. <BR /> Results: We
aim at identifying the chemical evolution of manganese, as a function of
metallicity, in the Galactic bulge. We find [Mn/Fe] \~{} -0.7 at [Fe/H] \~{}
-1.3, increasing to a solar value at metallicities close to solar, and
showing a spread around - 0.7 {\lsim} [Fe/H] {\lsim} -0.2, in good
agreement with other work on Mn in bulge stars. There is also good
agreement with chemical evolution models. We find no clear difference in
the behaviour of the four bulge fields. Whereas [Mn/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] could
be identified with the behaviour of the thick disc stars, [Mn/O] vs.
[O/H] has a behaviour running parallel, at higher metallicities,
compared to thick disc stars, indicating that the bulge enrichment might
have proceeded differently from that of the thick disc.

to be long period binaries. It is confirmed that the abundance patterns
show an enhancement of the {$\alpha$}-elements (like Mg, Ca), of the proton
capture elements (like Na and Al) and a strong enrichment in ``r'' and
``s'' process elements, where the s-enrichment is probably due to a mass
transfer episode from a companion in its AGB phase. The possible origins
of the abundance pattern and especially of the strong enhancement of
both ``s'' and ``r'' elements are discussed.

  Abstract                 = {{Context: NGC 6522 has been the first metal-poor globular cluster
identified in the bulge by Baade. Despite its importance, very few
high-resolution abundance analyses of stars in this cluster are
available. The bulge metal-poor clusters may be important tracers of the
early chemical enrichment of the Galaxy. <BR />Aims: The main purpose
of this study is to determine metallicity and elemental ratios in
individual stars of NGC 6522. <BR />Methods: High-resolution spectra
of 8 giants of the bulge's globular cluster NGC 6522 were obtained at
the 8m VLT UT2-Kueyen telescope with the FLAMES+GIRAFFE spectrograph.
Multiband V, I, J, K$_{s}$ photometry was used to derive effective
temperatures as reference values. Spectroscopic parameters were derived
from Fe i and Fe ii lines, and adopted for the derivation of abundance
ratios. <BR />Results: The present analysis provides a metallicity
[Fe/H] = -1.0 {\plusmn} 0.2. The {$\alpha$}-elements oxygen, magnesium and
silicon show [O/Fe] = +0.4 {\plusmn} 0.3, [Mg/Fe] = [Si/Fe] =
+0.25{\plusmn}0.15, whereas calcium and titanium show shallower ratios of
[Ca/Fe] = [Ti/Fe] = +0.15 {\plusmn} 0.15. The neutron-capture r-process
element europium appears to be overabundant by [Eu/Fe] = +0.4 {\plusmn}
0.4. The neutron-capture s-elements lanthanum and barium are enhanced by
[La/Fe] = +0.35 {\plusmn} 0.2 and [Ba/Fe] = +0.5 {\plusmn} 0.5. The large
internal errors, indicating the large star-to-star variation in the
barium and europium abundances, are also discussed. <BR />Conclusions:
The moderate metallicity combined to a blue horizontal branch (BHB), are
characteristics similar to those of HP 1 and NGC 6558, pointing to a
population of very old globular clusters in the Galactic bulge. Also,
the abundance ratios in NGC 6522 resemble those in HP 1 and NGC 6558.
The ultimate conclusion is that the bulge is old, and went through an
early prompt chemical enrichment.

  Abstract                 = {{We present, for the first time, a detailed abundance analysis of five
giant stars in the moderately metal-poor bulge globular cluster NGC
6558. Spectra have been obtained at the VLT with the multifiber
spectrograph FLAMES in GIRAFFE mode (R \~{} 22,000). The resulting iron
abundance is [Fe/H] = -0.97 {\plusmn} 0.15, in good agreement with the
metallicity inferred from the slope of the red giant branch, but
unusually high for a cluster with such a blue horizontal branch,
possibly indicating an old age. A color-magnitude diagram in V and I,
based on photometry obtained with the Wide-Field Imager at ESO, is also
presented. An isochrone of 14 Gyr fits the evolutionary sequences,
confirming an old age. NGC 6558 is another ''second-parameter'' bulge
cluster. The metallicity derived is near the end of the low-metallicity
tail of the bulge field-star distribution; hence, it presumably formed
at the very early stages of the bulge formation. Abundance ratios show
enhancements of the {$\alpha$}-elements oxygen, magnesium, and silicon,
with [O/Fe] = +0.38, [Mg/Fe] = +0.24, [Si/Fe] = +0.23, and solar calcium
and titanium. The r-element europium is also enhanced by [Eu/Fe] =
+0.36. The odd-Z elements sodium and aluminum, as well as the s-elements
barium and lanthanum, show solar ratios. A heliocentric radial velocity
of v = -197.3 {\plusmn} 4 km s$^{-1}$ is found for NGC 6558.

be third with such characteristics, but it differs from them, since
these two other clusters have also a populous Red HB, and a normal slope
of the RGB for their metallicity, which is not the case of HP-1.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Elements heavier than iron are produced through neutron-capture
processes in the different phases of stellar evolution. Asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars are believed to be mainly responsible for elements
that form through the slow neutron-capture process, while the elements
created in the rapid neutron-capture process have production sites that
are less understood. Knowledge of abundance ratios as functions of
metallicity can lead to insight into the origin and evolution of our
Galaxy and its stellar populations. <BR /> Aims: We aim to trace the
chemical evolution of the neutron-capture elements Sr, Zr, La, Ce, Nd,
Sm, and Eu in the Milky Way stellar disk. This will allow us to
constrain the formation sites of these elements, as well as to probe the
evolution of the Galactic thin and thick disks. <BR /> Methods: Using
spectra of high resolution (42 000 {\lsim} R {\lsim} 65 000) and high
signal-to-noise (S/N {\gsim} 200) obtained with the MIKE and the FEROS
spectrographs, we determine Sr, Zr, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu abundances
for a sample of 593 F and G dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood. The
abundance analysis is based on spectral synthesis using one-dimensional,
plane-parallel, local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model stellar
atmospheres calculated with the MARCS 2012 code. <BR /> Results: We
present abundance results for Sr (156 stars), Zr (311 stars), La (242
stars), Ce (365 stars), Nd (395 stars), Sm (280 stars), and Eu (378
stars). We find that Nd, Sm, and Eu show trends similar to what is
observed for the {$\alpha$} elements in the [X/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance plane.
For [Sr/Fe] and [Zr/Fe], we find decreasing abundance ratios for
increasing metallicity, reaching sub-solar values at super-solar
metallicities. [La/Fe] and [Ce/Fe] do not show any clear trend with
metallicity, and they are close to solar values at all [Fe/H]. The
trends of abundance ratios [X/Fe] as a function of stellar ages present
different slopes before and after 8 Gyr. <BR /> Conclusions: The rapid
neutron-capture process is active early in the Galaxy, mainly in type-II
supernovae from stars in the mass range 8-10 M$_{&sun;}$. Europium
is almost completely produced by the r-process, but Nd and Sm show
similar trends to Eu even if their s-process component is higher.
Strontium and Zr are thought to be mainly produced by the s-process, but
show significant enrichment at low metallicity that requires extra
r-process production, which probably is different from the classical
r-process. Finally, La and Ce are mainly produced via s-process from AGB
stars in the mass range 2-4 M$_{&sun;}$, which can be seen by the
decrease in [La/Eu] and [Ce/Eu] at [Fe/H] {\ap} -0.5. The trend of [X/Fe]
with age could be explained by considering that the decrease in [X/Fe]
for the thick disk stars can be due to the decrease in type-II
supernovae with time, meaning a reduced enrichment of r-process elements
in the interstellar medium. In the thin disk, the trends are flatter,
which is probably due to the main production from the s-process being
balanced by Fe production from type-Ia supernovae.

  Abstract                 = {{When the core hydrogen is exhausted during stellar evolution, the
central region of a star contracts and the outer envelope expands and
cools, giving rise to a red giant. Convection takes place over much of
the star's radius. Conservation of angular momentum requires that the
cores of these stars rotate faster than their envelopes; indirect
evidence supports this. Information about the angular-momentum
distribution is inaccessible to direct observations, but it can be
extracted from the effect of rotation on oscillation modes that probe
the stellar interior. Here we report an increasing rotation rate from
the surface of the star to the stellar core in the interiors of red
giants, obtained using the rotational frequency splitting of recently
detected `mixed modes'. By comparison with theoretical stellar models,
we conclude that the core must rotate at least ten times faster than the
surface. This observational result confirms the theoretical prediction
of a steep gradient in the rotation profile towards the deep stellar
interior.

clear oscillations in a large sample of G and K giants, extending in
luminosity from the red clump down to the bottom of the giant branch. We
confirm a strong correlation between the large separation of the
oscillations ({$\Delta$}{$\nu$}) and the frequency of maximum power
({$\nu$}$_{max}$). We focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars

high signal-to-noise ratios and showing the unambiguous signature of
solar-like oscillations. These are H-shell-burning stars, whose
oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellar evolution
and for constraining the star formation rate in the local disk. We use a
new technique to compare stars on a single {\'e}chelle diagram by
scaling their frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to
radial and non-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes
with angular degree l = 3. Measuring the small separation between l = 0
and l = 2 allows us to plot the so-called C-D diagram of
{$\delta$}{$\nu$}$_{02}$ versus {$\Delta$}{$\nu$}. The small separation
{$\delta$}{$\nu$}$_{01}$ of l = 1 from the midpoint of adjacent l = 0
modes is negative, contrary to the Sun and solar-type stars. The ridge
for l = 1 is notably broadened, which we attribute to mixed modes,
confirming theoretical predictions for low-luminosity giants. Overall,
the results demonstrate the tremendous potential of Kepler data for
asteroseismology of red giants.

in their cores and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell. Once a
red giant is sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes
fusion. Outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include
uncertainties in the amount of mass lost at the surface before helium
ignition and the amount of internal mixing from rotation and other
processes. Progress is hampered by our inability to distinguish between
red giants burning helium in the core and those still only burning
hydrogen in a shell. Asteroseismology offers a way forward, being a
powerful tool for probing the internal structures of stars using their
natural oscillation frequencies. Here we report observations of
gravity-mode period spacings in red giants that permit a distinction
between evolutionary stages to be made. We use high-precision photometry
obtained by the Kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure
oscillations in several hundred red giants. We find many stars whose
dipole modes show sequences with approximately regular period spacings.
These stars fall into two clear groups, allowing us to distinguish
unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars (period spacing
mostly \~{}50seconds) and those that are also burning helium (period
spacing \~{}100 to 300 seconds).

Milky Way halo into at least two distinct components, an inner halo and
an outer halo. This result has been criticized by Sch{\"o}nrich et al.,
who claim that the retrograde signature associated with the outer halo
is due to the adoption of faulty distances. We refute this claim, and
demonstrate that the Sch{\"o}nrich et al. photometric distances are
themselves flawed because they adopted an incorrect main-sequence
absolute magnitude relationship from the work of Ivezi{\'c} et al.
When compared to the recommended relation from Ivezi{\'c} et al.,
which is tied to a Milky Way globular cluster distance scale and
accounts for age and metallicity effects, the relation adopted by
Sch{\"o}nrich et al. yields up to 18\% shorter distances for stars near
the main-sequence turnoff (TO). Use of the correct relationship yields
agreement between the distances assigned by Carollo et al. and
Ivezi{\'c} et al. for low-metallicity dwarfs to within 6\%-10\%.
Sch{\"o}nrich et al. also point out that intermediate-gravity stars
(3.5 $\lt$=log g $\lt$ 4.0) with colors redder than the TO region are
likely misclassified, with which we concur. We implement a new procedure
to reassign luminosity classifications for the TO stars that require it.
New derivations of the rotational behavior demonstrate that the
retrograde signature and high velocity dispersion of the outer-halo
population remain. We summarize additional lines of evidence for a dual
halo, including a test of the retrograde signature based on proper
motions alone, and conclude that the preponderance of evidence strongly
rejects the single-halo interpretation.

barely used to infer the physical properties of stars. Nevertheless,
thanks to the CoRoT and Kepler spacecrafts it is now possible to measure
damping rates for hundreds of main-sequence and thousands of red-giant
stars with unprecedented precision. By using a non-adiabatic pulsation
code including a time-dependent convection treatment, we compute damping
rates for stellar models that are representative of solar-like pulsators
from the main-sequence to the red-giant phase. This allows us to
reproduce the observations of both CoRoT and Kepler, which validates our
modeling of mode damping rates and thus the underlying physical
mechanisms included in the modeling. By considering the perturbations of
turbulent pressure and entropy (including the perturbation of the
dissipation rate of turbulent energy into heat) by the oscillation in
our computation, we succeed in reproducing the observed relation between
damping rates and effective temperature. Moreover, we discuss the
physical reasons for mode damping rates to scale with effective
temperature, as observationally exhibited. Finally, this opens the way
for the use of mode damping rates to probe turbulent convection in
solar-like stars.

  Abstract                 = {{Asteroseismology of stars that exhibit solar-like oscillations are
enjoying a growing interest with the wealth of observational results
obtained with the CoRoT and Kepler missions. In this framework, scaling
laws between asteroseismic quantities and stellar parameters are
becoming essential tools to study a rich variety of stars. However, the
physical underlying mechanisms of those scaling laws are still poorly
known. Our objective is to provide a theoretical basis for the scaling
between the frequency of the maximum in the power spectrum
({$\nu$}$_{max}$) of solar-like oscillations and the cut-off
frequency ({$\nu$}$_{c}$). Using the SoHO GOLF observations together
with theoretical considerations, we first confirm that the maximum of
the height in oscillation power spectrum is determined by the so-called
plateau of the damping rates. The physical origin of the plateau can be
traced to the destabilizing effect of the Lagrangian perturbation of
entropy in the upper-most layers, which becomes important when the modal
period and the local thermal relaxation time-scale are comparable. Based
on this analysis, we then find a linear relation between
{$\nu$}$_{max}$ and {$\nu$}$_{c}$, with a coefficient that depends
on the ratio of the Mach number of the exciting turbulence to the third
power to the mixing-length parameter.

Kepler space-craft, solar-like oscillations have appeared to be a common
feature of low-mass stars from the main-sequence to the red-giant
phases. In this context, scaling relations that relate
asteroseismological quantities and stellar parameters are an essential
tool in the study a large class of stars. Most of these relations
concern the connection between pulsations and turbulent convection.
Therefore, a deep investigation of this connection is necessary to
obtain insight into the processes underlying mode driving and damping
and consequently to improve our knowledge of the scaling relations. This
is a key step that will permit us to perform a leap forward in our
understanding of stellar interiors.

the power spectrum of solar-like oscillations ({$\nu$}$_{max}$) and
the cut-off frequency ({$\nu$}$_{c}$). For the first relation, we
will consider the possible sources of uncertainties and explore them
with the help of a grid of stellar models. For the second one, we will
show that the basic physical picture is understood and that departure
from the observed relation arises from the complexity of non-adiabatic
processes involving the time-dependent treatment of convection. This
will be further discussed on the basis of a set of three-dimensional
(3D) hydrodynamical simulations of surface convection.

  Abstract                 = {{We present a detailed elemental abundance study of 90 F and G dwarf,
turn-off and subgiant stars in the Galactic bulge. Based on
high-resolution spectra acquired during gravitational microlensing
events, stellar ages and abundances for 11 elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca,
Ti, Cr, Fe, Zn, Y and Ba) have been determined. We find that the
Galactic bulge has a wide metallicity distribution with significant
peaks at [Fe/H]=-1.09, -0.63, -0.20, +0.12, +0.41. We also find a high
fraction of intermediate-age to young stars: at [Fe/H]$\gt$0 more than 35
\% are younger than 8 Gyr. For [Fe/H]$\lt$-0.5 most stars are 10 Gyr or
older. We have also identified several episodes when significant star
formation in the bulge happened: 3, 6, 8, and 12 Gyr ago. We further
find that the ``knee'' in the alpha-element abundance trends of the
sub-solar metallicity bulge is located at about 0.1 dex higher [Fe/H]
than in the local thick disk. The Galactic bulge has complex age and
abundance properties that appear to be tightly connected to the main
Galactic stellar populations. In particular, the peaks in the
metallicity distribution, the star formation episodes, and the abundance
trends, show similarities with the properties of the Galactic thin and
thick disks. At the same time there are additional components not seen
outside the bulge region, and that most likely can be associated with
the Galactic bar. For instance, the star formation rate appears to have
been slightly faster in the bulge than in the local thick disk, which
most likely is an indication of the denser stellar environment closer to
the Galactic centre. Our results strengthen the observational evidence
that support the idea of a secular origin for the Galactic bulge, formed
out of the other main Galactic stellar populations present in the
central regions of our Galaxy.

differ significantly from those usually assumed in evolutionary
calculations. <BR />Aims: In order to improve upon this situation, we
have computed tracks and isochrones in the range of initial masses 0.15
- 20 M$_{&sun;}$ for a grid of 39 chemical compositions with the
metal content Z between 0.0001 and 0.070 and helium content Y between
0.23 and 0.46. <BR />Methods: The Padova stellar evolution code has
been implemented with updated physics. New synthetic TP-AGB models allow
the extension of stellar models and isochrones until the end of the
thermal pulses along the AGB. Software tools for the bidimensional
interpolation (in Y and Z) of the tracks have been tuned. <BR
/>Results: This first paper presents tracks for low mass stars (from
0.15 to 2.5 M\_{\sun}) with scaled-solar abundances and the corresponding
isochrones from very old ages down to about 1 Gyr. <BR />Conclusions:
Tracks and isochrones are made available in tabular form for the adopted
grid of chemical compositions in the plane Z-Y. As soon as possible an
interactive web interface will allow users to obtain isochrones of any
chemical composition and also simulated stellar populations with
different Y(Z) helium-to-metal enrichment laws.

across the Galactic disk using H-band spectra from the Apache Point
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We minimized systematic errors
by considering groups of stars with similar atmospheric parameters. The
APOGEE measurements in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12
reveal that the square root of the star-to-star cosmic variance in
oxygen at a given metallicity is about 0.03-0.04 dex in both the thin
and thick disk. This is about twice as high as the spread found for
solar twins in the immediate solar neighborhood and is probably caused
by the wider range of galactocentric distances spanned by APOGEE stars.
We quantified measurement uncertainties by examining the spread among
stars with the same parameters in clusters; these errors are a function
of effective temperature and metallicity, ranging between 0.005 dex at
4000 K and solar metallicity, to about 0.03 dex at 4500 K and [Fe/H]=
-0.6. We argue that measuring the spread in [O/Fe] and other abundance
ratios provides strong constraints for models of Galactic chemical
evolution.

from two different oxygen lines at 6158 {\AA} and 6300 {\AA} in a
large sample of solar-type stars. The results are used to check the
behaviour of these spectral lines as oxygen abundance indicators and to
study the evolution of oxygen in thick and thin disk populations of the
Galaxy. <BR /> Methods: Equivalent width measurements were carried out
for the [OI] 6158 {\AA} and OI 6300 {\AA} lines. Local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) abundances were obtained from these two lines in 610
and 535 stars, respectively. We were able to measure oxygen abundance
from both indicators in 447 stars enabling us for the first time to
compare them in a uniform way. Careful error analysis has been
performed. <BR /> Results: We found that oxygen abundances derived from
the 6158 {\AA} and 6300 {\AA} lines agree to within 0.1 dex in 58\%
of the stars in our sample, and this result improves for higher
signal-to-noise values. We confirm an oxygen enhancement in stars of the
thick disk, as has also been seen for other {$\alpha$}-elements. The new
oxygen abundances confirm previous findings for a progressive linear
rise in the oxygen-to-iron ratio with a slope equal to 0.78 from solar
metallicity to [Fe/H] \~{} -1. However, the slope we measured is steeper
than the one found in previous studies based on the oxygen triplet.
Below [Fe/H] = -0.6 our stars show [O/Fe] ratios as high as \~{}0.8, which
can be interpreted as evidence for oxygen overproduction in the Galactic
thick disk. These high oxygen abundances do not pose a problem to
chemodynamical models since there is a range of parameters that can
accommodate our results.

  Abstract                 = {{Standard star photometry dominated the latter half of the twentieth
century reaching its zenith in the 1980s. It was introduced to take
advantage of the high sensitivity and large dynamic range of
photomultiplier tubes compared to photographic plates. As the quantum
efficiency of photodetectors improved and the wavelength range extended
further to the red, standard systems were modified and refined, and
deviations from the original systems proliferated. The revolutionary
shift to area detectors for all optical and IR observations forced
further changes to standard systems, and the precision and accuracy of
much broad- and intermediate-band photometry suffered until more
suitable observational techniques and standard reduction procedures were
adopted. But the biggest revolution occurred with the production of
all-sky photometric surveys. Hipparcos/Tycho was space based, but most,
like 2MASS, were ground-based, dedicated survey telescopes. It is very
likely that in the future, rather than making a measurement of an object
in some standard photometric system, one will simply look up the
magnitudes and colors of most objects in catalogs accessed from the
Virtual Observatory. In this review the history of standard star
photometry will be outlined, and the calibration and realization of
standard systems will be examined. Finally, model atmosphere fluxes are
now very realistic, and synthetic photometry offers the best prospects
for calibrating all photometric systems. Synthetic photometry from
observed spectrophotometry should also be used as a matter of course to
provide colors within standard systems and to gain insights into the
spectra and colors of unusual stars, star clusters and distant galaxies.

necessary for a deep understanding of its formation and evolution.
Connections between the globular cluster and field star properties in
terms of kinematics, orbits, chemical abundances and ages should shed
light on different stellar population components. Based on spatial
distribution and metallicity, we define a probable best list of bulge
clusters, containing 43 entries. Future work on newly discovered
objects, mostly from the VVV survey, is suggested. These candidates
might alleviate the issue of missing clusters on the far side of the
bulge. We discuss the reddening law affecting the cluster distances
towards the center of the Galaxy, and conclude that the most suitable
total-to-selective absorption value appears to be R$\_{\rm V}$=3.2, in
agreement with recent analyses. An update of elemental abundances for
bulge clusters is provided.

connecting the Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC and SMC). These
objects are used to study the formation and evolution of star clusters
and associations under tidal stresses from the Clouds. Typical star
clusters in the Bridge are not richly populated and have in general
relatively large diameters ({\ap}30-35 pc), being larger than Galactic
counterparts of similar age. Ages and other fundamental parameters are
determined with field-star decontaminated photometry. A self-consistent
approach is used to derive parameters for the most-populated sample
cluster NGC 796 and two young CMD templates built with the remaining
Bridge clusters. We find that the clusters are not coeval in the Bridge.
They range from approximately a few Myr (still related to optical H II
regions and WISE and Spitzer dust emission measurements) to about
100-200 Myr. The derived distance moduli for the Bridge objects
(1$^{h}$56$^{m}$ $\lt$ {$\alpha$} $\lt$
2$^{h}$28$^{m}$) suggests that the Bridge is a structure
connecting the LMC farside in the east to the foreground of the SMC to
the west. Most of the present clusters are part of the tidal dwarf
candidate D 1, which is associated with an H I overdensity. We find
further evidence that the studied part of the Bridge is evolving into a
tidal dwarf galaxy, decoupling from the Bridge.

periods of orbits depended only on energy. He named this potential the
isochrone, and discovered that it provided a good representation of data
for globular clusters. He sought an explanation in terms of resonant
relaxation. The role that resonant relaxation might play in globular
clusters is still an open question, but the isochrone potential is
guaranteed a role in dynamical astronomy because it is the most general
potential in which closed-form expressions for angle-action coordinates
are available. I explain how this property makes the isochrone
invaluable for the powerful technique of torus mapping. I also describe
flattened isochrone models, which enable us to explore a powerful
general method of generating self-consistent stellar systems.

parameters for the distance moduli of stars for which the RAdial
Velocity Experiment (RAVE) has obtained spectra with S/N {\ge} 10.
Single-Gaussian fits to the pdf in distance modulus suffice for roughly
half the stars, with most of the other half having satisfactory
two-Gaussian representations. As expected, early-type stars rarely
require more than one Gaussian. The expectation value of distance is
larger than the distance implied by the expectation of distance modulus;
the latter is itself larger than the distance implied by the expectation
value of the parallax. Our parallaxes of Hipparcos stars agree well with
the values measured by Hipparcos, so the expectation of parallax is the
most reliable distance indicator. The latter are improved by taking
extinction into account. The effective temperature-absolute magnitude
diagram of our stars is significantly improved when these pdfs are used
to make the diagram. We use the method of kinematic corrections devised
by Sch{\"o}nrich, Binney and Asplund to check for systematic errors for
general stars and confirm that the most reliable distance indicator is
the expectation of parallax. For cool dwarfs and low-gravity giants,
{\lt}{\piv}{\gt} tends to be larger than the true distance by up to 30 per
cent. The most satisfactory distances are for dwarfs hotter than 5500 K.
We compare our distances to stars in 13 open clusters with cluster
distances from the literature and find excellent agreement for the
dwarfs and indications that we are overestimating distances to giants,
especially in young clusters.

{\tilde}2 kpc of the Sun and have spectra measured in the Radial Velocity
Experiment. We decompose the sample into hot and cold dwarfs, red-clump
and non-clump giants. The kinematics of the clump giants are consistent
with being identical with those of the giants as a whole. Without
binning the data we fit Gaussian velocity ellipsoids to the
meridional-plane components of velocity of each star class and give
formulae from which the shape and orientation of the velocity ellipsoid
can be determined at any location. The data are consistent with the
giants and the cool dwarfs sharing the same velocity ellipsoids, which
have vertical velocity dispersion rising from 21 km s$^{-1}$ in
the plane to {\tilde}55 km s$^{-1}$ at |z| = 2 kpc and radial
velocity dispersion rising from 37 km s$^{-1}$ to 82 km
s$^{-1}$ in the same interval. At (R, z), the longest axis of one
of these velocity ellipsoids is inclined to the Galactic plane by an
angle {\tilde}0.8 arctan(z/R). We use a novel formula to obtain precise
fits to the highly non-Gaussian distributions of v$_{phi}$
components in eight bins in the (R, z) plane. We compare the observed
velocity distributions with the predictions of a published dynamical
model fitted to the velocities of stars that lie within {\tilde}150 pc of
the Sun and star counts towards the Galactic pole. The predictions for
the v$_{z}$ distributions are exceptionally successful. The
model's predictions for v$_{phi}$ are successful except for the
hot dwarfs, and its predictions for v$_{r}$ fail significantly
only for giants that lie far from the plane. If distances to the model's
stars are overestimated by 20 per cent, the predicted distributions of
v$_{r}$ and v$_{z}$ components become skew, and far from the
plane broader. The broadening significantly improves the fits to the
data. The ability of the dynamical model to give such a good account of
a large body of data to which it was not fitted inspires confidence in
the fundamental correctness of the assumed, disc-dominated,
gravitational potential.

  Abstract                 = {{Equilibrium dynamical models are essential tools for extracting science
from surveys of our Galaxy. We show how models can be tested with data
from a survey before the survey's selection function has been
determined. We illustrate the application of this method by presenting
some results for the RAVE survey. We extend our published analytic
distribution functions to include chemistry and fit the chosen
functional form to a combination of the Geneva-Copenhagen survey (GCS)
and a sample of G-dwarfs observed at z \~{} 1.75 kpc by the SEGUE survey.
By including solid dynamics we are able to predict the contribution that
the thick disc/halo stars surveyed by SEGUE should make to the GCS
survey. We show that the measured [Fe/H] distribution from the GCS
includes many fewer stars at [Fe/H] {\lt} -0.6 than are predicted. The
problem is more likely to lie in discordant abundance scales than with
incorrect dynamics.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Stars are born together from giant molecular clouds and, if we
assume that the priors were chemically homogeneous and well-mixed, we
expect them to share the same chemical composition. Most of the stellar
aggregates are disrupted while orbiting the Galaxy and most of the
dynamic information is lost, thus the only possibility of reconstructing
the stellar formation history is to analyze the chemical abundances that
we observe today. Aims. The chemical tagging technique aims to recover
disrupted stellar clusters based merely on their chemical composition.
We evaluate the viability of this technique to recover co-natal stars
that are no longer gravitationally bound. Methods. Open clusters are
co-natal aggregates that have managed to survive together. We compiled
stellar spectra from 31 old and intermediate-age open clusters,
homogeneously derived atmospheric parameters, and 17 abundance species,
and applied machine learning algorithms to group the stars based on
their chemical composition. This approach allows us to evaluate the
viability and efficiency of the chemical tagging technique. Results. We
found that stars at different evolutionary stages have distinct chemical
patterns that may be due to NLTE effects, atomic diffusion, mixing, and
biases. When separating stars into dwarfs and giants, we observed that a
few open clusters show distinct chemical signatures while the majority
show a high degree of overlap. This limits the recovery of co-natal
aggregates by applying the chemical tagging technique. Nevertheless,
there is room for improvement if more elements are included and models
are improved.

galaxies. It is the only galaxy whose formation history can be studied
using the full distribution of stars from faint dwarfs to supergiants.
The oldest components provide us with unique insight into how galaxies
form and evolve over billions of years. The Galaxy is a luminous
(L$_{*}$) barred spiral with a central box/peanut bulge, a
dominant disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. Based on global properties,
it falls in the sparsely populated {\ldquo}green valley{\rdquo} region of
the galaxy color-magnitude diagram. Here we review the key integrated,
structural and kinematic parameters of the Galaxy, and point to
uncertainties as well as directions for future progress. Galactic
studies will continue to play a fundamental role far into the future
because there are measurements that can only be made in the near field
and much of contemporary astrophysics depends on such observations.

  Abstract                 = {{We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), a project
encompassing three major spectroscopic programs. The Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing
hundreds of thousands of Milky Way stars at high resolution and high
signal-to-noise ratios in the near-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies
at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey is obtaining spatially
resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby galaxies (median z{\sim}
0.03). The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is
mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas distributions between z{\sim}
0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using baryon acoustic oscillations,
redshift space distortions, and the shape of the power spectrum. Within
eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the SPectroscopic
IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray AGNs
and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey
(TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5
m Sloan Foundation Telescope at the Apache Point Observatory;
observations there began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second
near-infrared spectrograph at the 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las
Campanas Observatory, with observations beginning in early 2017.
Observations at both facilities are scheduled to continue through 2020.
In keeping with previous SDSS policy, SDSS-IV provides regularly
scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data Release 13, was made
available in 2016 July.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Ongoing and future massive spectroscopic surveys will collect
large numbers (10$^{6}$-10$^{7}$) of stellar spectra that
need to be analyzed. Highly automated software is needed to derive
stellar parameters and chemical abundances from these spectra. <BR />
Aims: We developed a new method of estimating the stellar parameters
T$_{eff}$, log g, [M/H], and elemental abundances. This method was
implemented in a new code, SP\_Ace (Stellar Parameters And Chemical
abundances Estimator). This is a highly automated code suitable for
analyzing the spectra of large spectroscopic surveys with low or medium
spectral resolution (R = 2000-20 000). <BR /> Methods: After the
astrophysical calibration of the oscillator strengths of 4643 absorption
lines covering the wavelength ranges 5212-6860 {\AA} and 8400-8924
{\AA}, we constructed a library that contains the equivalent widths
(EW) of these lines for a grid of stellar parameters. The EWs of each
line are fit by a polynomial function that describes the EW of the line
as a function of the stellar parameters. The coefficients of these
polynomial functions are stored in a library called the ''GCOG library''.
SP\_Ace, a code written in FORTRAN95, uses the GCOG library to compute
the EWs of the lines, constructs models of spectra as a function of the
stellar parameters and abundances, and searches for the model that
minimizes the {$\chi$}$^{2}$ deviation when compared to the observed
spectrum. The code has been tested on synthetic and real spectra for a
wide range of signal-to-noise and spectral resolutions. <BR /> Results:
SP\_Ace derives stellar parameters such as T$_{eff}$, log g, [M/H],
and chemical abundances of up to ten elements for low to medium
resolution spectra of FGK-type stars with precision comparable to the
one usually obtained with spectra of higher resolution. Systematic
errors in stellar parameters and chemical abundances are presented and
identified with tests on synthetic and real spectra. Stochastic errors
are automatically estimated by the code for all the parameters. A simple
Web front end of SP\_Ace can be found at <a href=''http://dc.g-vo.org/SP\_ACE''>
http://dc.g-vo.org/SP\_ACE</a> while the source code will be published soon.

the Milky Way by measuring the radial and vertical chemical gradients
for the elements Mg, Al, Si, Ti, and Fe in the Galactic disc and the
gradient variations as a function of the distance from the Galactic
plane (Z). <BR /> Methods: We selected a sample of giant stars from the
RAVE database using the gravity criterium 1.7 {\lt}log g{\lt} 2.8. We
created a RAVE mock sample with the Galaxia code based on the
Besan{\c c}on model and selected a corresponding mock sample to
compare the model with the observed data. We measured the radial
gradients and the vertical gradients as a function of the distance from
the Galactic plane Z to study their variation across the Galactic disc.
<BR /> Results: The RAVE sample exhibits a negative radial gradient of
d[Fe/H]/dR = -0.054 dex kpc$^{-1}$ close to the Galactic plane (|
Z | {\lt} 0.4 kpc) that becomes flatter for larger | Z |. Other elements
follow the same trend although with some variations from element to
element. The mock sample has radial gradients in fair agreement with the
observed data. The variation of the gradients with Z shows that the Fe
radial gradient of the RAVE sample has little change in the range | Z |
{\lsim} 0.6 kpc and then flattens. The iron vertical gradient of the RAVE
sample is slightly negative close to the Galactic plane and steepens
with | Z |. The mock sample exhibits an iron vertical gradient that is
always steeper than the RAVE sample. The mock sample also shows an
excess of metal-poor stars in the [Fe/H] distributions with respect to
the observed data. These discrepancies can be reduced by decreasing the
number of thick disc stars and increasing their average metallicity in
the Besan{\c c}on model.

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: We aim at measuring the chemical gradients of the elements
Mg, Al, Si, and Fe along the Galactic radius to provide new constraints
on the chemical evolution models of the Galaxy and Galaxy models such as
the Besan{\c c}on model. Thanks to the large number of stars of our
RAVE sample we can study how the gradients vary as function of the
distance from the Galactic plane. <BR /> Methods: We analysed three
different samples selected from three independent datasets: a sample of
19 962 dwarf stars selected from the RAVE database, a sample of 10 616
dwarf stars selected from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS) dataset,
and a mock sample (equivalent to the RAVE sample) created by using the
GALAXIA code, which is based on the Besan{\c c}on model. The three
samples were analysed by using the very same method for comparison
purposes. We integrated the Galactic orbits and obtained the guiding
radii (R$_{g}$) and the maximum distances from the Galactic plane
reached by the stars along their orbits (Z$_{max}$). We measured
the chemical gradients as functions of R$_{g}$ at different
Z$_{max}$. <BR /> Results: We found that the chemical gradients of
the RAVE and GCS samples are negative and show consistent trends,
although they are not equal: at Z$_{max}${\lt} 0.4 kpc and 4.5
{\lt}R$_{g}$(kpc) {\lt} 9.5, the iron gradient for the RAVE sample
is d [Fe/H] /dR$_{g}$ = -0.065 dex kpc$^{-1}$, whereas for
the GCS sample it is d [Fe/H] /dR$_{g}$ = -0.043 dex
kpc$^{-1}$ with internal errors of {\plusmn}0.002 and {\plusmn}0.004
dex kpc$^{-1}$, respectively. The gradients of the RAVE and GCS
samples become flatter at larger Z$_{max}$. Conversely, the mock
sample has a positive iron gradient of d [Fe/H] /dR$_{g}$ = +0.053
{\plusmn} 0.003 dex kpc$^{-1}$ at Z$_{max}${\lt} 0.4 kpc and
remains positive at any Z$_{max}$. These positive and unrealistic
values originate from the lack of correlation between metallicity and
tangential velocity in the Besan{\c c}on model. In addition, the low
metallicity and asymmetric drift of the thick disc causes a shift of the
stars towards lower R$_{g}$ and metallicity which, together with
the thin-disc stars with a higher metallicity and R$_{g}$,
generates a fictitious positive gradient of the full sample. The flatter
gradient at larger Z$_{max}$ found in the RAVE and the GCS samples
may therefore be due to the superposition of thin- and thick-disc stars,
which mimicks a flatter or positive gradient. This does not exclude the
possibility that the thick disc has no chemical gradient. The
discrepancies between the observational samples and the mock sample can
be reduced by i) decreasing the density; ii) decreasing the vertical
velocity; and iii) increasing the metallicity of the thick disc in the
Besan{\c c}on model.

  Abstract                 = {{We have studied the chemical enrichment history of the interstellar
medium through an analysis of the n-dimensional stellar abundance space.
This work is a non-parametric analysis of the stellar chemical abundance
space. The main goal is to study the stars from their organization
within this abundance space. Within this space, we seek to find clusters
(in a statistical sense), that is, stars likely to share similar
chemo-evolutionary history, using two methods: the hierarchical
clustering and the principal component analysis. We analysed some
selected abundance surveys available in the literature. For each sample,
we labelled the group of stars according to its average abundance curve.
In all samples, we identify the existence of a main enrichment pattern
of the stars, which we call chemical enrichment flow. This flow is set
by the structured and well-defined mean rate at which the abundances of
the interstellar medium increase, resulting from the mixture of the
material ejected from the stars and stellar mass-loss and interstellar
medium gas. One of the main results of our analysis is the
identification of subgroups of stars with peculiar chemistry. These
stars are situated in regions outside of the enrichment flow in the
abundance space. These peculiar stars show a mismatch in the enrichment
rate of a few elements, such as Mg, Si, Sc and V, when compared to the
mean enrichment rate of the other elements of the same stars. We believe
that the existence of these groups of stars with peculiar chemistry may
be related to the accretion of planetary material on to stellar surfaces
or may be due to production of the same chemical element by different
nucleosynthetic sites.

efficiency is independent of galactic mass, while massive discs have, on
average, lower gas fractions and are redder than their low-mass
counterparts; put together, these findings convincingly suggest that
massive spirals are older than low-mass ones. We evaluate the effective
ages of the galaxies of our sample and we find that massive spirals must
be several Gyr older than low-mass ones. We also show that these
galaxies (having rotational velocities in the 80-400kms$^{-1}$
range) cannot have suffered extensive mass losses, i.e. they cannot have
lost during their lifetime an amount of mass much larger than their
current content of gas+stars.

observational data on present-day galactic discs, including disc sizes
and central surface brightness, Tully-Fisher relations in various
wavelength bands, colour-colour and colour-magnitude relations, gas
fractions versus magnitudes and colours and abundances versus local and
integrated properties, as well as spectra for different galactic
rotational velocities. Despite the extremely simple nature of our
models, we find satisfactory agreement with all those observables,
provided that the time-scale for star formation in low-mass discs is
longer than for more massive ones. This assumption is apparently in
contradiction with the standard picture of hierarchical cosmology. We
find, however, that it is extremely successful in reproducing major
features of present-day discs, like the change in the slope of the
Tully-Fisher relation with wavelength, the fact that more massive
galaxies are on average `redder' than low-mass ones (a generic problem
of standard hierarchical models) and the metallicity-luminosity relation
for spirals. It is concluded that, on a purely empirical basis, this new
picture is at least as successful as the standard one. Observations at
high redshifts could help to distinguish between the two possibilities.

light profiles, atomic and molecular gas (deduced from CO with a
metallicity-dependent conversion factor), star formation rates (from
H{$\alpha$} emissivities), metallicities, dispersion velocities and
rotation curves. We show that the Toomre criterion applies successfully
to the case of the Milky Way disc, but it has limited success with the
data of our sample; depending on whether or not the stellar component is
included in the stability analysis, we find average values for the
threshold ratio of the gas surface density to the critical surface
density in the range 0.5-0.7. We also test various star formation laws
proposed in the literature, i.e. either the simple Schmidt law or
modifications of it, that take into account dynamical factors. We find
only small differences among them as far as the overall fit to our data
is concerned; in particular, we find that all three star formation laws
(with parameters derived from the fits to our data) match observations
in the Milky Way disc particularly well. In all cases we find that the
exponent n of our best-fitting star formation rate has slightly higher
values than in other recent works and we suggest several reasons that
may cause that discrepancy.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are related to the final stages
of evolution of very massive stars. As such, they should follow the star
formation rate (SFR) of galaxies. We can use them to probe for
star-forming galaxies in the distant universe following this assumption.
The relation between the rate of LGRBs in a given galaxy and its SFR
(which we call the LGRB bias) may however be complex, as we have good
indications that the LGRB hosts are not perfect analogues to the general
population of star-forming galaxies. <BR /> Aims: In this work, we try
to quantify how the LGRB bias depends on physical parameters of their
host galaxy, such as SFR or stellar mass. These trends may reveal more
fundamental properties such as the role of the metallicity of LGRBs and
of their progenitors . <BR /> Methods: We propose an empirical method
based on the comparison of stellar mass functions (and SFR
distributions) of LGRB hosts and of star-forming galaxies to find how
the bias depends on the stellar mass or the SFR. <BR /> Results: By
applying this method to a sample of LGRB hosts at redshifts lower than
1.1, where the properties of star-forming galaxies are fairly well
established and where the properties of LGRB host galaxies can be
deduced from observations (limiting ourselves to stellar masses higher
than 10$^{9.25}$ M$_{&sun;}$ and SFR higher than \~{}1.8
M$_{&sun;}$ yr$^{-1}$), we find that the LGRB bias depends
on both the stellar mass and SFR. We find that the bias decreases with
the SFR; that is, we see no preference for highly star-forming galaxies,
once we account for the higher number of massive stars in galaxies with
larger SFR. We do not find any trend with the specific star formation
rate (SSFR), but the dynamical range in SSFR in our study is narrow.
Through an indirect method, we relate these trends to a possible
decrease in the LGRBs rate / SFR ratio with the metallicity. <BR />
Conclusions: The method we propose suggests trends that may be useful to
constrain models of LGRB progenitors, showing a clear decrease in the
LGRB bias with the metallicity. This is promising for the future as the
number of LGRB hosts studied will increase.

moving at a relative speed of at least 220 km s$^{-1}$ with
respect to the local standard of rest. These stars are generally less
metal-rich than the disk, but surprisingly, half of our halo sample is
comprised of stars with [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$]$\gt$ -1. The orbital directions of
these metal-rich halo stars are preferentially aligned with the disk
rotation, in sharp contrast with the intrinsically isotropic orbital
distribution of the metal-poor halo stars. We find similar properties in
the Latte cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy
from the FIRE project. In Latte, metal-rich halo stars formed primarily
inside of the solar circle, whereas lower-metallicity halo stars
preferentially formed at larger distances (extending beyond the virial
radius). This suggests that metal-rich halo stars in the solar
neighborhood actually formed in situ within the Galactic disk, rather
than having been accreted from satellite systems. These stars, currently
on halo-like orbits, therefore have likely undergone substantial radial
migration/heating.

the six ESO Public Surveys operating on the new 4-m Visible and Infrared
Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA). VVV is scanning the Milky Way
bulge and an adjacent section of the disk, where star formation activity
is high. One of the principal goals of the VVV Survey is to find new
star clusters of differentages. <BR /> Aims: In order to trace the early
epochs of star cluster formation we concentrated our search in the
directions to those of known star formation regions, masers, radio, and
infrared sources. <BR /> Methods: The disk area covered by VVV was
visually inspected using the pipeline processed and calibrated
K$_{S}$-band tile images for stellar overdensities. Subsequently,
we examined the composite JHK$_{S}$ and ZJK$_{S}$ color
images of each candidate. PSF photometry of 15 {\times} 15 arcmin fields
centered on the candidates was then performed on the Cambridge Astronomy
Survey Unit reduced images. After statistical field-star
decontamination, color-magnitude and color-color diagrams were
constructed and analyzed. <BR /> Results: We report the discovery of 96
new infrared open clusters and stellar groups. Most of the new cluster
candidates are faint and compact (with small angular sizes), highly
reddened, and younger than 5 Myr. For relatively well populated cluster
candidates we derived their fundamental parameters such as reddening,
distance, and age by fitting the solar-metallicity Padova isochrones to
the color-magnitude diagrams.

  Abstract                 = {{The formation of thick stellar disks in spiral galaxies is studied.
Simulations of gas-rich young galaxies show formation of internal clumps
by gravitational instabilities, clump coalescence into a bulge, and disk
thickening by strong stellar scattering. The bulge and thick disks of
modern galaxies may form this way. Simulations of minor mergers make
thick disks too, but there is an important difference. Thick disks made
by internal processes have a constant scale height with galactocentric
radius, but thick disks made by mergers flare. The difference arises
because in the first case, perpendicular forcing and disk-gravity
resistance are both proportional to the disk column density, so the
resulting scale height is independent of this density. In the case of
mergers, perpendicular forcing is independent of the column density and
the low-density regions get thicker; the resulting flaring is
inconsistent with observations. Late-stage gas accretion and thin-disk
growth are shown to preserve the constant scale heights of thick disks
formed by internal evolution. These results reinforce the idea that disk
galaxies accrete most of their mass smoothly and acquire their structure
by internal processes, in particular through turbulent and clumpy phases
at high redshift.

in particular depend linearly on proper motion and parallax. I use data
for 304 267 main-sequence stars from the Gaia DR1 Tycho-Gaia Astrometric
Solution to perform a local, precise measurement of the Oort constants
at a typical heliocentric distance of 230 pc. The pattern of proper
motions for these stars clearly displays the expected effects from
differential rotation. I measure the Oort constants to be: A = 15.3

km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, C = -3.2 {\plusmn} 0.4 km

clearly demonstrate the importance of non-axisymmetry for the velocity

non-axisymmetric models of the Milky Way.

data from the Gaia DR1 Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution, we reconstruct
Gaia's selection function and we determine Gaia's volume completeness,
the local number density, and the vertical profiles of different
spectral types along the main sequence from early A stars to late K
stars as well as along the giant branch. We clearly detect the expected
flattening of the stellar density profile near the mid-plane for all
stellar types: All vertical profiles are well represented by sech\^{}2
profiles, with scale heights ranging from \~{}50 pc for A stars to \~{}150 pc
for G and K dwarfs and giants. We determine the luminosity function
along the main sequence for M\_V $\lt$ 7 (M $\gt$\~{} $0.72 M\_\odot$) and
along the giant branch for M\_J $\gt$\~{} -2.5. Converting this to a mass
function, we find that the high-mass (M $\gt$ $1\,M\_\odot$) present-day
mass function along the main sequence is d n / d M = 0.016
$(M/M\_\odot)^{-4.7}$ stars/pc\^{}3/$M\_\odot$. Extrapolating below M =
$0.72\,M\_\odot$, we find a total mid-plane stellar density of
0.040+/-0.002 $M\_\odot$/pc\^{}3. Giants contribute 0.00039+/-0.00001
stars/pc\^{}3 or about 0.00046+/-0.00005 $M\_\odot$/pc\^{}3. The star-formation
rate surface density is $\backslash$Sigma(t) = 7+/-1 exp(-t/[7+/-1 Gyr])
$M\_\odot$/pc\^{}2/Gyr. Overall, we find that Gaia DR1's selection biases
are manageable and allow a detailed new inventory of the solar
neighborhood to be made that agrees with and extends previous studies.
This bodes well for mapping the Milky Way with the full Gaia data set.

  Abstract                 = {{Determining the level of chemical homogeneity in open clusters is of
fundamental importance in the study of the evolution of star-forming
clouds and that of the Galactic disk. Yet limiting the initial abundance
spread in clusters has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining
consistent spectroscopic abundances for different stellar types. Without
reference to any specific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a
homogeneous cluster is that it forms a one-dimensional sequence, with
any differences between members due to variations in stellar mass and
observational uncertainties. I present a novel method for investigating
the abundance spread in open clusters that tests this one-dimensional
hypothesis at the level of observed stellar spectra, rather than
constraining homogeneity using derived abundances as is traditionally
done. Using high-resolution APOGEE spectra for 49 giants in M67, NGC
6819, and NGC 2420 I demonstrate that these spectra form one-dimensional
sequences for each cluster. With detailed forward modeling of the
spectra and Approximate Bayesian Computation, I derive strong limits on
the initial abundance spread of 15 elements: $\lt$0.01 (0.02) $\{$dex$\}$ for C
and Fe, {\lsim}0.015 (0.03) $\{$dex$\}$ for N, O, Mg, Si, and Ni, {\lsim}0.02
(0.03) $\{$dex$\}$ for Al, Ca, and Mn, and {\lsim}0.03 (0.05) $\{$dex$\}$ for Na, S,
K, Ti, and V (at 68\% and 95\% confidence, respectively). The strong
limits on C and O imply that no pollution by massive core-collapse
supernovae occurred during star formation in open clusters, which, thus,
need to form within {\lsim}6 $\{$Myr$\}$. Further development of this and
related techniques will bring the power of differential abundances to
stars other than solar twins in large spectroscopic surveys and will
help unravel the history of star formation and chemical enrichment in
the Milky Way through chemical tagging.

  Abstract                 = {{I describe the design, implementation, and usage of galpy, a python
package for galactic-dynamics calculations. At its core, galpy consists
of a general framework for representing galactic potentials both in
python and in C (for accelerated computations); galpy functions,
objects, and methods can generally take arbitrary combinations of these
as arguments. Numerical orbit integration is supported with a variety of
Runge-Kutta-type and symplectic integrators. For planar orbits,
integration of the phase-space volume is also possible. galpy supports
the calculation of action-angle coordinates and orbital frequencies for
a given phase-space point for general spherical potentials, using
state-of-the-art numerical approximations for axisymmetric potentials,
and making use of a recent general approximation for any static
potential. A number of different distribution functions (DFs) are also
included in the current release; currently, these consist of
two-dimensional axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric disk DFs, a
three-dimensional disk DF, and a DF framework for tidal streams. I
provide several examples to illustrate the use of the code. I present a
simple model for the Milky Way's gravitational potential consistent with
the latest observations. I also numerically calculate the Oort functions
for different tracer populations of stars and compare them to a new
analytical approximation. Additionally, I characterize the response of a
kinematically warm disk to an elliptical m = 2 perturbation in detail.
Overall, galpy consists of about 54,000 lines, including 23,000 lines of
code in the module, 11,000 lines of test code, and about 20,000 lines of
documentation. The test suite covers 99.6\% of the code. galpy is

  Abstract                 = {{I present a new framework for modeling the dynamics of tidal streams.
The framework consists of simple models for the initial action-angle
distribution of tidal debris, which can be straightforwardly evolved
forward in time. Taking advantage of the essentially one-dimensional
nature of tidal streams, the transformation to position-velocity
coordinates can be linearized and interpolated near a small number of
points along the stream, thus allowing for efficient computations of a
stream's properties in observable quantities. I illustrate how to
calculate the stream's average location (its ''track'') in different
coordinate systems, how to quickly estimate the dispersion around its
track, and how to draw mock stream data. As a generative model, this
framework allows one to compute the full probability distribution
function and marginalize over or condition it on certain phase-space
dimensions as well as convolve it with observational uncertainties. This
will be instrumental in proper data analysis of stream data. In addition
to providing a computationally efficient practical tool for modeling the
dynamics of tidal streams, the action-angle nature of the framework
helps elucidate how the observed width of the stream relates to the
velocity dispersion or mass of the progenitor, and how the progenitors
of ''orphan'' streams could be located. The practical usefulness of the
proposed framework crucially depends on the ability to calculate
action-angle variables for any orbit in any gravitational potential. A
novel method for calculating actions, frequencies, and angles in any
static potential using a single orbit integration is described in the
Appendix.

red-clump (RC) stars in APOGEE, we determine the large-scale

uncertainty is due to (1) a conservative 20 km s$^{-1}$
uncertainty in V$_{c}$ and (2) the estimated power on unobserved
larger scales. Combining the APOGEE peculiar-velocity field with RC
stars in RAVE out to 2 kpc from the Sun and with local GCS stars, we
determine the power spectrum of residual velocity fluctuations in the
MW's disk on scales between 0.2 kpc$^{-1}$ {\lt}= k {\lt}= 40
kpc$^{-1}$. Most of the power is contained in a broad peak
between 0.2 kpc$^{-1}$ {\lt} k {\lt} 0.9
kpc$^{-1}$. We investigate the expected power spectrum for
various non-axisymmetric perturbations and demonstrate that the central
bar with commonly used parameters but of relatively high mass can
explain the bulk of velocity fluctuations in the plane of the Galactic
disk near the Sun. Streaming motions {\ap}10 km s$^{-1}$ on
{\gt}\~{} 3 kpc scales in the MW are in good agreement with observations of
external galaxies and directly explain why local determinations of the
solar motion are inconsistent with global measurements.

for modeling steady-state systems is among the most flexible, allowing
non-parametric distribution functions in complex gravitational
potentials to be modeled efficiently using N-body particles. Here we
propose and test various improvements to the standard M2M method for
modeling observed data, illustrated using the simple setup of a
one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. We demonstrate that nuisance
parameters describing the modeled system's orientation with respect to
the observer---e.g., an external galaxy's inclination or the Sun's
position in the Milky Way---as well as the parameters of an external
gravitational field can be optimized simultaneously with the particle
weights. We develop a method for sampling from the high-dimensional
uncertainty distribution of the particle weights. We combine this in a
Gibbs sampler with samplers for the nuisance and potential parameters to
explore the uncertainty distribution of the full set of parameters. We
illustrate our M2M improvements by modeling the vertical density and
kinematics of F-type stars in Gaia DR1. The novel M2M method proposed
here allows full probabilistic modeling of steady-state dynamical
systems, allowing uncertainties on the non-parametric distribution
function and on nuisance parameters to be taken into account when
constraining the dark and baryonic masses of stellar systems.

of small-scale structure in the extinction. This formalism demonstrates
that the spatially complex effect of extinction on the selection
function of a pencil-beam or contiguous sky survey is equivalent to a
low-pass filtering of the extinction-affected selection function with
the smooth density field. We find that the angular resolution of current
3D extinction maps is sufficient for analyzing Gaia sub-samples of
millions of stars. However, the current distance resolution is
inadequate and needs to be improved by an order of magnitude, especially
in the inner Galaxy. We also present a practical and efficient method
for properly taking the effect of extinction into account in analyses of
Galactic structure through an effective selection function. We
illustrate its use with the selection function of red-clump stars in
APOGEE using and comparing a variety of current 3D extinction maps.

  Abstract                 = {{The spatial structure of stellar populations with different chemical
abundances in the Milky Way (MW) contains a wealth of information on
Galactic evolution over cosmic time. We use data on 14,699 red-clump
stars from the APOGEE survey, covering 4 $\{$kpc$\}${\lsim} R{\lsim} 15 $\{$kpc$\}$,
to determine the structure of mono-abundance populations
(MAPs){\mdash}stars in narrow bins in [{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] and
[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$]{\mdash}accounting for the complex effects of the APOGEE
selection function and the spatially variable dust obscuration. We
determine that all MAPs with enhanced [{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] are centrally
concentrated and are well-described as exponentials with a scale length
of 2.2+/- 0.2 $\{$kpc$\}$ over the whole radial range of the disk. We discover
that the surface-density profiles of low-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] MAPs are
complex: they do not monotonically decrease outwards, but rather display
a peak radius ranging from {\ap} 5 to {\ap} 13 $\{$kpc$\}$ at low [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$].
The extensive radial coverage of the data allows us to measure radial
trends in the thickness of each MAP. While high-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] MAPs
have constant scale heights, low-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] MAPs flare. We confirm,
now with high-precision abundances, previous results that each MAP
contains only a single vertical scale height and that low-[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$],
low-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] and high-[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$], high-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] MAPs
have intermediate ($\{$h$\}$$_{Z}${\ap} 300$\{$--$\}$600 $\{$pc$\}$) scale heights
that smoothly bridge the traditional thin- and thick-disk divide. That
the high-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$], thick disk components do not flare is strong
evidence against their thickness being caused by radial migration. The
correspondence between the radial structure and chemical-enrichment age
of stellar populations is clear confirmation of the inside-out growth of
galactic disks. The details of these relations will constrain the
variety of physical conditions under which stars form throughout the MW
disk.

sequence at the clusters{\rsquo} spectroscopic metallicity: more massive
stars appear, at high significance, to be younger than less massive
stars. This discrepancy is consistent with earlier studies, but vanishes
when including stellar rotation. The entire upper main sequence of both
clusters is very well-fit by a distribution of 800 Myr old stars with
the spectroscopically measured [Fe/H] = 0.12. The increase over the
consensus age of {\sim}600{\ndash}650 Myr is due both to the revised solar
metallicity (from $\{$Z$\}$$_{o }${\ap} 0.02 to $\{$Z$\}$$_{o
}${\ap} 0.014) and to the lengthening of main-sequence lifetimes and
increase in luminosities with rapid rotation. Our results show that
rotation can remove the need for large age spreads in intermediate-age
clusters, and that these clusters may be significantly older than is
commonly accepted. A Hyades/Praesepe age of {\sim}800 Myr would also
require a recalibration of rotation/activity age indicators.

intermediate-age Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) clusters, often attributed
to age spreads of several 100 Myr, may be easily accounted for by
variable stellar rotation in a coeval population. We compute synthetic
photometry for grids of rotating stellar evolution models and
interpolate them to produce isochrones at a variety of rotation rates
and orientations. An extended main-sequence turnoff naturally appears in
color{\ndash}magnitude diagrams at ages just under 1 Gyr, peaks in extent
between {\sim}1 and 1.5 Gyr, and gradually disappears by around 2 Gyr in
age. We then fit our interpolated isochrones by eye to four LMC clusters
with very extended main-sequence turnoffs: NGC 1783, 1806, 1846, and
1987. In each case, stellar populations with a single age and
metallicity can comfortably account for the observed extent of the
turnoff region. The new stellar models predict almost no correlation of
turnoff color with rotational v$\{$sin$\}$i. The red part of the turnoff is
populated by a combination of slow rotators and edge-on rapid rotators,
while the blue part contains rapid rotators at lower inclinations.

the ages and other properties of early-type stars. We find good
agreement for early-type stars and clusters with known young ages,
including {$\beta$} Pictoris, the Pleiades, and the Ursa Majoris moving
group. However, we derive a substantially older age for the Hyades open
cluster (750 {\plusmn} 100 Myr compared to 625 {\plusmn} 50 Myr). This
older age results from both the increase in main-sequence lifetime with
stellar rotation and from the fact that rotating models near the
main-sequence turnoff are more luminous, overlapping with slightly more
massive (and shorter-lived) nonrotating ones. Our method uses a large
grid of nonrotating models to interpolate between a much sparser
rotating grid, and also includes a detailed calculation of synthetic
magnitudes as a function of orientation. We provide a web interface at
http://www.bayesianstellarparameters.info, where the results of our
analysis may be downloaded for individual early-type (B-V{\lsim} 0.25)
Hipparcos stars. The web interface accepts user-supplied parameters for

  Abstract                 = {{The accuracy of stellar masses and radii determined from
asteroseismology is not known! We examine this issue for giant stars by
comparing classical measurements of detached eclipsing binary systems
(dEBs) with asteroseismic measurements from the Kepler mission. For star
clusters, we extrapolate measurements of dEBs in the turn-off region to
the red giant branch and the red clump where we investigate the giants
as an ensemble. For the field stars, we measure dEBs with an oscillating
giant component. These measurements allow a comparison of masses and
radii calculated from a classical eclipsing binary analysis to those
calculated from asteroseismic scaling relations and/or other
asteroseismic methods. Our first results indicate small but significant
systematic differences between the classical and asteroseismic
measurements. In this contribution we show our latest results and
summarize the current status and future plans. We also stress the
importance of realizing that for giant stars mass cannot always be
translated to age, since an unknown fraction of these evolved through a
blue straggler phase with mass transfer in a binary system. Rough
estimates of how many such stars to expect are given based on our
findings in the open clusters NGC 6819 and NGC 6791.

process of identifying and measuring parameters for detached eclipsing
binaries (dEBs) in the open clusters in the Kepler and CoRoT fields. We
make use of measurements of dEBs in the clusters to test the accuracy of
asteroseismic scaling relations for mass. We are able to provide strong
indications that the asteroseismic scaling relations overestimate the
stellar mass, but we are not yet able to distinguish between different
proposed corrections from the literature. We argue how our ongoing
measurements of more dEBs in more clusters, complemented by dEBs in the
field, should be able to break the degeneracy. We also briefly describe
how we can identify cluster stars that have evolved through non-standard
evolution by making use of ensemble asteroseismology.

Galaxies in a Cosmological Context) project, spanning stellar mass from
{\tilde}10$^{7}$ to 3 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{&sun;}$, we
trace the baryonic cycle of infalling gas from the virial radius through
to its eventual participation in the star formation process. An emphasis
is placed upon the temporal history of chemical enrichment during its
passage through the corona and circumgalactic medium. We derive the
distributions of time between gas crossing the virial radius and being
accreted to the star-forming region (which allows for mixing within the
corona), as well as the time between gas being accreted to the
star-forming region and then ultimately forming stars (which allows for
mixing within the disc). Significant numbers of stars are formed from
gas that cycles back through the hot halo after first accreting to the
star-forming region. Gas entering high-mass galaxies is pre-enriched in
low-mass proto-galaxies prior to entering the virial radius of the
central progenitor, with only small amounts of primordial gas accreted,
even at high redshift (z {\tilde} 5). After entering the virial radius,
significant further enrichment occurs prior to the accretion of the gas
to the star-forming region, with gas that is feeding the star-forming
region surpassing 0.1 Z$_{&sun;}$ by z = 0. Mixing with halo gas,
itself enriched via galactic fountains, is thus crucial in determining
the metallicity at which gas is accreted to the disc. The lowest mass
simulated galaxy (M$_{vir}$ {\tilde} 2 {\times} 10$^{10}$
M$_{&sun;}$, with M$_{*}$ {\tilde} 10$^{7}$
M$_{&sun;}$), by contrast, accretes primordial gas through the
virial radius and on to the disc, throughout its history. Much like the
case for classical analytical solutions to the so-called `G-dwarf
problem', overproduction of low-metallicity stars is ameliorated by the
interplay between the time of accretion on to the disc and the
subsequent involvement in star formation - i.e. due to the inefficiency
of star formation. Finally, gas outflow/metal removal rates from
star-forming regions as a function of galactic mass are presented.

Making Galaxies in a Cosmological Context (MaGICC) programme, also match
observed relations between luminosity, rotation velocity, size, colour,
star formation rate, H I mass, baryonic mass and metallicity. Radiation
energy feedback from massive stars and supernova energy balance the
complex interplay between cooling gas, regulated star formation,
large-scale outflows and recycling of gas in a manner which correctly
scales with the mass of the galaxy. Outflows, driven by the expansion of
shells and superbubbles of overlapping supernova explosions, also play a
key role in simulating galaxies with exponential surface brightness
profiles, flat rotation curves and dark matter cores. Our study implies
that large-scale outflows are the primary driver of the dependence of
disc galaxy properties on mass. We show that the degree of outflows
invoked in our model is required to meet the constraints provided by
observations of O VI absorption lines in the circumgalactic media of
nearby galaxies.

with sub-components which can be assigned to a thin stellar disc, thick
disc and a low-mass stellar halo via a chemical decomposition. The thin-
and thick-disc populations so selected are distinct in their ages,
kinematics and metallicities. Thin-disc stars are young ({\lt}6.6 Gyr),
possess low velocity dispersion ({$\sigma$}$_{U, V, W}$ = 41, 31, 25
km s$^{-1}$), high [Fe/H] and low [O/Fe]. Conversely, the
thick-disc stars are old (6.6 {\lt} age {\lt} 9.8 Gyr), lag the thin disc
by {\tilde}21 km s$^{-1}$, possess higher velocity dispersion
({$\sigma$}$_{U, V, W}$ = 49, 44, 35 km s$^{-1}$) and have
relatively low [Fe/H] and high [O/Fe]. The halo component comprises less
than 4 per cent of stars in the 'solar annulus' of the simulation, has
low metallicity, a velocity ellipsoid defined by {$\sigma$}$_{U, V,
W}$ = 62, 46, 45 km s$^{-1}$ and is formed primarily in situ
during an early merger epoch. Gas-rich mergers during this epoch play a
major role in fuelling the formation of the old-disc stars (the thick
disc). We demonstrate that this is consistent with studies which show
that cold accretion is the main source of a disc galaxy's baryons. Our
simulation initially forms a relatively short (scalelength {\tilde}1.7
kpc at z = 1) and kinematically hot disc, primarily from gas accreted
during the galaxy's merger epoch. Far from being a competing formation
scenario, we show that migration is crucial for reconciling the short,
hot, discs which form at high redshift in {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter,
with the properties of the thick disc at z = 0. The thick disc, as
defined by its abundances, maintains its relatively short scalelength at
z = 0 (2.31 kpc) compared with the total disc scalelength of 2.73 kpc.
The inside-out nature of disc growth is imprinted in the evolution of
abundances such that the metal-poor {$\alpha$}-young population has a
larger scalelength (4.07 kpc) than the more chemically evolved
metal-rich {$\alpha$}-young population (2.74 kpc).

of a typical barred disk galaxy by calculating the local spatial
diffusion coefficient and diffusion time-scale for bulge-disk-halo
N-body self-consistent systems which initially differ in the
Safronov-Toomre-Q$_{T}$ parameter. We find different diffusion
scenarios that depend on the bar strength and on the degree of
instability of the disk. Marginally stable disks, with Q$_{T}$ \~{}
1, have two families of bar orbits with different values of angular
momentum and energy, which determine a large diffusion in the corotation
region. In hot disks, Q$_{T}$ {\gt} 1, stellar diffusion is reduced
with respect to the case of marginally stable disks. In cold models, we
find that spatial diffusion is not constant in time and strongly depends
on the activity of the bar, which can move stars all over the disk
recurrently. We conclude that to realistically study the impact of
radial migration on the chemical evolution modeling of the Milky Way the
role of the bar has to be taken into account.

  Abstract                 = {{We present a detailed spectroscopic study of 93 solar-type stars that
are targets of the NASA/Kepler mission and provide detailed chemical
composition of each target. We find that the overall metallicity is well
represented by Fe lines. Relative abundances of light elements (CNO) and
{$\alpha$} elements are generally higher for low-metallicity stars. Our
spectroscopic analysis benefits from the accurately measured surface
gravity from the asteroseismic analysis of the Kepler light curves. The
accuracy on the log g parameter is better than 0.03 dex and is held
fixed in the analysis. We compare our T$_{eff}$ determination with
a recent colour calibration of V$_{T}$-K$_{S}$ [TYCHO V
magnitude minus Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) K$_{S}$
magnitude] and find very good agreement and a scatter of only 80 K,
showing that for other nearby Kepler targets, this index can be used.
The asteroseismic log g values agree very well with the classical
determination using Fe I-Fe II balance, although we find a small
systematic offset of 0.08 dex (asteroseismic log g values are lower).
The abundance patterns of metals, {$\alpha$} elements and the light
elements (CNO) show that a simple scaling by [Fe/H] is adequate to
represent the metallicity of the stars, except for the stars with
metallicity below -0.3, where {$\alpha$}-enhancement becomes important.
However, this is only important for a very small fraction of the Kepler
sample. We therefore recommend that a simple scaling with [Fe/H] be
employed in the asteroseismic analyses of large ensembles of solar-type
stars.

  Abstract                 = {{Molecular clouds at very high latitude (\$b{\gt}60\^{}$\{$$\backslash$circ$\}$\$) away from the
Galactic plane are rare and in general are expected to be
non-star-forming. However, we report the discovery of two embedded
clusters (Camargo 438 and Camargo 439) within the high-latitude
molecular cloud HRK 81.4-77.8 using WISE. Camargo 439 with Galactic
coordinates \$$\backslash$ell=81.11\^{}$\{$$\backslash$circ$\}$\$ and \$b=-77.84\^{}$\{$$\backslash$circ$\}$\$ is an \$$\backslash$sim2\$
Myr embedded cluster (EC) located at a distance from the Sun of
\$d\_$\{$$\backslash$odot$\}$=5.09$\backslash$pm0.47\$ kpc. Adopting the distance of the Sun to the
Galactic centre \$R\_$\{$$\backslash$odot$\}$=7.2\$ kpc we derive for Camargo 439 a
Galactocentric distance of \$R\_$\{$GC$\}$=8.70$\backslash$pm0.26\$ kpc and a vertical
distance from the plane of \$-4.97$\backslash$pm0.46\$ kpc. Camargo 438 at
\$$\backslash$ell=79.66\^{}$\{$$\backslash$circ$\}$\$ and \$b=-78.86\^{}$\{$$\backslash$circ$\}$\$ presents similar values. The
derived parameters for these two ECs put HRK 81.4-77.8 in the halo at a
distance from the Galactic centre of \$$\backslash$sim8.7\$ kpc and \$$\backslash$sim5.0\$ kpc
from the disc. Star clusters provide the only direct means to determine
the high latitude molecular cloud distances. The present study shows
that the molecular cloud HRK 81.4-77.8 is currently forming stars,
apparently an unprecedented event detected so far among high latitude
clouds. We carried out a preliminary orbit analysis. It shows that this
ECs are the most distant known embedded clusters from the plane and both
cloud and clusters are probably falling ballistically from the halo onto
the Galactic disc, or performing a flyby.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Chemically inhomogeneous populations are observed in most
globular clusters, but not in open clusters. Cluster mass seems to play
a key role in the existence of multiple populations. <BR /> Aims:
Studying the chemical homogeneity of the most massive open clusters is
needed to better understand the mechanism of their formation and
determine the mass limit under which clusters cannot host multiple
populations. Here we studied NGC 6705, which is a young and massive open
cluster located towards the inner region of the Milky Way. This cluster
is located inside the solar circle. This makes it an important tracer of
the inner disk abundance gradient. <BR /> Methods: This study makes use
of BVI and ri photometry and comparisons with theoretical isochrones to
derive the age of NGC 6705. We study the density profile of the cluster
and the mass function to infer the cluster mass. Based on abundances of
the chemical elements distributed in the first internal data release of
the Gaia-ESO Survey, we study elemental ratios and the chemical
homogeneity of the red clump stars. Radial velocities enable us to study
the rotation and internal kinematics of the cluster. <BR /> Results: The
estimated ages range from 250 to 316 Myr, depending on the adopted
stellar model. Luminosity profiles and mass functions show strong signs
of mass segregation. We derive the mass of the cluster from its
luminosity function and from the kinematics, finding values between 3700
M$_{&sun;}$ and 11 000 M$_{&sun;}$. After selecting the
cluster members from their radial velocities, we obtain a metallicity of
[Fe/H] = 0.10 {\plusmn} 0.06 based on 21 candidate members. Moreover, NGC
6705 shows no sign of the typical correlations or anti-correlations
between Al, Mg, Si, and Na, which are expected in multiple populations.
This is consistent with our cluster mass estimate, which is lower than
the required mass limit proposed in the literature to develop multiple
populations.

  Abstract                 = {{We present a method to estimate distances to stars with
spectroscopically derived stellar parameters. The technique is a
Bayesian approach with likelihood estimated via comparison of measured
parameters to a grid of stellar isochrones, and returns a posterior
probability density function for each star{\rsquo}s absolute magnitude.
This technique is tailored specifically to data from the Large Sky Area
Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey. Because
LAMOST obtains roughly 3000 stellar spectra simultaneously within each
{\sim}5{\deg} diameter {\ldquo}plate{\rdquo} that is observed, we can use
the stellar parameters of the observed stars to account for the stellar
luminosity function and target selection effects. This removes biasing
assumptions about the underlying populations, both due to predictions of
the luminosity function from stellar evolution modeling, and from
Galactic models of stellar populations along each line of sight. Using
calibration data of stars with known distances and stellar parameters,
we show that our method recovers distances for most stars within
{\sim}20\%, but with some systematic overestimation of distances to halo
giants. We apply our code to the LAMOST database, and show that the
current precision of LAMOST stellar parameters permits measurements of
distances with {\sim}40\% error bars. This precision should improve as the
LAMOST data pipelines continue to be refined.

  Abstract                 = {{Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the halo components of the
Milky Way are explored, based on accurate determinations of the
carbon-to-iron ([C/Fe]) abundance ratios and kinematic quantities for
over 30,000 calibration stars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using
our present criterion that low-metallicity stars exhibiting [C/Fe]
ratios (''carbonicity'') in excess of [C/Fe] =+0.7 are considered CEMP
stars, the global frequency of CEMP stars in the halo system for [Fe/H]
{\lt}-1.5 is 8\%, for [Fe/H] {\lt}-2.0 it is 12\%, and for [Fe/H] {\lt}-2.5
it is 20\%. We also confirm a significant increase in the level of carbon
enrichment with declining metallicity, growing from lang[C/Fe]rang \~{}+1.0
at [Fe/H] =-1.5 to lang[C/Fe]rang \~{}+1.7 at [Fe/H] =-2.7. The nature of
the carbonicity distribution function (CarDF) changes dramatically with
increasing distance above the Galactic plane, |Z|. For |Z| {\lt}5 kpc,
relatively few CEMP stars are identified. For distances |Z| {\gt}5 kpc,
the CarDF exhibits a strong tail toward high values, up to [C/Fe] {\gt}
+3.0. We also find a clear increase in the CEMP frequency with |Z|. For
stars with -2.0 {\lt} [Fe/H] {\lt}-1.5, the frequency grows from 5\% at |Z|
\~{}2 kpc to 10\% at |Z| \~{}10 kpc. For stars with [Fe/H] {\lt}-2.0, the
frequency grows from 8\% at |Z| \~{}2 kpc to 25\% at |Z| \~{}10 kpc. For stars
with -2.0 {\lt} [Fe/H] {\lt}-1.5, the mean carbonicity is lang[C/Fe]rang
\~{}+1.0 for 0 kpc {\lt} |Z| {\lt} 10 kpc, with little dependence on |Z|; for
[Fe/H] {\lt}-2.0, lang[C/Fe]rang \~{}+1.5, again roughly independent of |Z|.
Based on a statistical separation of the halo components in velocity
space, we find evidence for a significant contrast in the frequency of
CEMP stars between the inner- and outer-halo components{\mdash}the outer
halo possesses roughly twice the fraction of CEMP stars as the inner
halo. The carbonicity distribution also differs between the inner-halo
and outer-halo components{\mdash}the inner halo has a greater portion of
stars with modest carbon enhancement ([C/Fe] \~{}+0.5]); the outer halo has
a greater portion of stars with large enhancements ([C/Fe] \~{}+2.0),
although considerable overlap still exists. We interpret these results
as due to the possible presence of additional astrophysical sources of
carbon production associated with outer-halo stars, beyond the
asymptotic giant-branch source that may dominate for inner-halo stars,
with implications for the progenitors of these populations.

Milky Way are explored, based on well-determined atmospheric parameters
and kinematic quantities for 32360 ''calibration stars'' from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and its first extension, SDSS-II, which
included the sub-survey Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and
Exploration (SEGUE). Full space motions for a sub-sample of 16,920
stars, exploring a local volume within 4 kpc of the Sun, are used to
derive velocity ellipsoids for the inner- and outer-halo components of
the Galaxy, as well as for the canonical thick-disk and proposed
metal-weak thick-disk (MWTD) populations. This new sample of calibration
stars represents an increase of 60\% relative to the numbers used in a
previous analysis. We first examine the question of whether the data
require the presence of at least a two-component halo in order to
account for the rotational behavior of likely halo stars in the local
volume, and whether more than two components are needed. We also address
the question of whether the proposed MWTD is kinematically and
chemically distinct from the canonical thick disk, and point out that
the Galactocentric rotational velocity inferred for the MWTD, as well as
its mean metallicity, appear quite similar to the values derived
previously for the Monoceros stream, suggesting a possible association
between these structures. In addition, we consider the fractions of each
component required to understand the nature of the observed kinematic
behavior of the stellar populations of the Galaxy as a function of
distance from the plane. Scale lengths and scale heights for the
thick-disk and MWTD components are determined. Spatial density profiles
for the inner- and outer-halo populations are inferred from a Jeans
theorem analysis. The full set of calibration stars (including those
outside the local volume) is used to test for the expected changes in
the observed stellar metallicity distribution function with distance
above the Galactic plane in situ, due to the changing contributions from
the underlying stellar populations. The above issues are considered, in
concert with theoretical and observational constraints from other
Milky-Way-like galaxies, in light of modern cold dark matter galaxy
formation models.

fide cluster members. From 10 of them we derive a global
[M/H]=+0.39+/-0.05. We therefore confirm that NGC 6791 is extremely
metal-rich, exhibits a few marginally subsolar abundance ratios, and
within the resolution of our spectra does not show evidence of spread in
metal abundance. With these new data we rederive the fundamental cluster
parameters, suggesting that it is about 8 Gyr old and 4.3 kpc from the
Sun. The combination of its chemical properties, age, position, and
Galactic orbit hardly makes NGC 6791 a genuine Population I open
cluster. We discuss possible interpretations of the cluster
peculiarities, suggesting that the cluster might be what remains of a
much larger system whose initial potential well could have been
sufficient to produce high-metallicity stars and which has been
depopulated by the tidal field of the Galaxy. Alternatively, its current
properties may be explained by the perturbation of the Galactic bar on
an object that originated well inside the solar ring, where the metal
enrichment was very fast.

through its 13 billion year old history is one of the major challenges
in the theory of galaxy formation. Achieving this goal is possible using
late-type stars, which in virtue of their long lifetimes can be regarded
as fossil remnants from various epochs of the formation of the Galaxy.
There are two main paths to reliably age-date late-type stars:
astrometric distances for stars in the turn-off and subgiant region, or
oscillation frequencies along the red giant branch. So far, these
methods have been applied to large samples of stars in the solar
neighbourhood, and in the Kepler field. I review these studies,
emphasize how they complement each other, and highlight some of the
constraints they provide for Galactic modelling. I conclude with the
prospects and synergies that astrometric (Gaia) and asteroseismic
space-borne missions reserve to the field of Galactic Archaeology, and
advocate that survey selection functions should be kept as simple as
possible, relying on basic observables such as colours and magnitudes
only.

  Abstract                 = {{The apparent size of stars is a crucial benchmark for fundamental
stellar properties such as effective temperatures, radii and surface
gravities. While interferometric measurements of stellar angular
diameters are the most direct method to gauge these, they are still
limited to relatively nearby and bright stars, which are saturated in
most of the modern photometric surveys. This dichotomy prevents us from
safely extending well-calibrated relations to the faint stars targeted
in large spectroscopic and photometric surveys. Here, we alleviate this
obstacle by presenting South African Astronomical Observatory
near-infrared JHK observations of 55 stars: 16 of them have
interferometric angular diameters and the rest are in common with the 2
Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS, unsaturated) data set, allowing us to tie
the effective temperatures and angular diameters derived via the
infrared flux method to the interferometric scale. We extend the test to
recent interferometric measurements of unsaturated 2MASS stars,
including giants, and the metal-poor benchmark target HD122563. With a
critical evaluation of the systematics involved, we conclude that a 1
per cent accuracy in fundamental stellar parameters is usually within
reach. Caution, however, must be used when indirectly testing a
T$_{eff}$ scale via colour relations as well as when assessing the
reliability of interferometric measurements, especially at
submilliarcsec level. As a result, rather different effective
temperature scales can be compatible with a given subset of
interferometric data. We highlight some caveats to be aware of in such a
quest and suggest a simple method to check against systematics in
fundamental measurements. A new diagnostic combination seismic radii

  Abstract                 = {{Solar infrared colors provide powerful constraints on the stellar
effective temperature scale, but they must be measured with both
accuracy and precision in order to do so. We fulfill this requirement by
using line-depth ratios to derive in a model-independent way the
infrared colors of the Sun, and we use the latter to test the zero point
of the Casagrande et al. effective temperature scale, confirming its
accuracy. Solar colors in the widely used Two Micron All Sky Survey
(2MASS) JHK$_{s}$ and WISE W1-4 systems are provided: (V -
J)$_{&sun;}$ = 1.198, (V - H)$_{&sun;}$ = 1.484,
(V - K$_{s}$ )$_{&sun;}$ = 1.560, (J -
H)$_{&sun;}$ = 0.286, (J - K$_{s}$
)$_{&sun;}$ = 0.362, (H - K$_{s}$
)$_{&sun;}$ = 0.076, (V - W1)$_{&sun;}$ = 1.608,
(V - W2)$_{&sun;}$ = 1.563, (V -
W3)$_{&sun;}$ = 1.552, and (V - W4)$_{&sun;}$ =
1.604. A cross-check of the effective temperatures derived implementing
2MASS or WISE magnitudes in the infrared flux method confirms that the
absolute calibration of the two systems agrees within the errors,
possibly suggesting a 1\% offset between the two, thus validating extant
near- and mid-infrared absolute calibrations. While 2MASS magnitudes are
usually well suited to derive $\backslash$textit $\{$T$\}$\_$\{$eff$\}$, we find that a number
of bright, solar-like stars exhibit anomalous WISE colors. In most
cases, this effect is spurious and can be attributed to lower-quality
measurements, although for a couple of objects (3\% {\plusmn} 2\% of the
total sample) it might be real, and may hint at the presence of warm/hot
debris disks.

  Abstract                 = {{The existence of a vertical age gradient in the Milky Way disc has been
indirectly known for long. Here, we measure it directly for the first
time with seismic ages, using red giants observed by Kepler. We use
Str{\"o}mgren photometry to gauge the selection function of
asteroseismic targets, and derive colour and magnitude limits where
giants with measured oscillations are representative of the underlying
population in the field. Limits in the 2MASS system are also derived. We
lay out a method to assess and correct for target selection effects
independent of Galaxy models. We find that low-mass, i.e. old red giants
dominate at increasing Galactic heights, whereas closer to the Galactic
plane they exhibit a wide range of ages and metallicities. Parametrizing
this as a vertical gradient returns approximately 4 Gyr kpc$^{-1}$
for the disc we probe, although with a large dispersion of ages at all
heights. The ages of stars show a smooth distribution over the last
{\sime}10 Gyr, consistent with a mostly quiescent evolution for the Milky
Way disc since a redshift of about 2. We also find a flat
age-metallicity relation for disc stars. Finally, we show how to use
secondary clump stars to estimate the present-day intrinsic metallicity
spread, and suggest using their number count as a new proxy for tracing
the ageing of the disc. This work highlights the power of
asteroseismology for Galactic studies; however, we also emphasize the
need for better constraints on stellar mass-loss, which is a major
source of systematic age uncertainties in red giant stars.

as the caveats of the derived effective temperatures, metallicities,

achieved precision is corroborated by the detection of the first and
secondary clumps in a population of field stars with a ratio of 2 to 1

the importance of an all-sky Str{\"o}mgren survey.

are carefully tested between them, with the Gaia FGK benchmark stars,

Finally, we compare our results with a chemodynamical model of the Milky

analysed homogeneously hampers the investigations about chemical
patterns and the existence of Galactocentric radial and vertical

designed the Open Cluster Chemical Abundances from Spanish Observatories
(OCCASO) survey. We aim to provide homogeneous radial velocities,
physical parameters and individual chemical abundances of six or more
red clump stars for a sample of 25 old and intermediate-age OCs visible
from the Northern hemisphere. To do so, we use high-resolution
spectroscopic facilities (R {\ge} 62 000) available at Spanish
observatories. We present the motivation, design and current status of
the survey, together with the first data release of radial velocities
for 77 stars in 12 OCs, which represents about 50 per cent of the
survey. We include clusters never studied with high-resolution
spectroscopy before (NGC 1907, NGC 6991, NGC 7762), and clusters in
common with other large spectroscopic surveys like the Gaia-ESO Survey
(NGC 6705) and Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment
(NGC 2682 and NGC 6819). We perform internal comparisons between
instruments to evaluate and correct internal systematics of the results,
and compare our radial velocities with previous determinations in the
literature, when available. Finally, radial velocities for each cluster
are used to perform a preliminary kinematic study in relation with the
Galactic disc.

  Abstract                 = {{There exists an inordinate amount of spectral data in both public and
private astronomical archives that remain severely under-utilized. The
lack of reliable open-source tools for analyzing large volumes of
spectra contributes to this situation, which is poised to worsen as
large surveys successively release orders of magnitude more spectra. In
this article I introduce sick, the spectroscopic inference crank, a
flexible and fast Bayesian tool for inferring astrophysical parameters
from spectra. sick is agnostic to the wavelength coverage, resolving
power, or general data format, allowing any user to easily construct a
generative model for their data, regardless of its source. sick can be
used to provide a nearest-neighbor estimate of model parameters, a
numerically optimized point estimate, or full Markov Chain Monte Carlo
sampling of the posterior probability distributions. This generality
empowers any astronomer to capitalize on the plethora of published
synthetic and observed spectra, and make precise inferences for a host
of astrophysical (and nuisance) quantities. Model intensities can be
reliably approximated from existing grids of synthetic or observed
spectra using linear multi-dimensional interpolation, or a Cannon-based
model. Additional phenomena that transform the data (e.g., redshift,
rotational broadening, continuum, spectral resolution) are incorporated
as free parameters and can be marginalized away. Outlier pixels (e.g.,
cosmic rays or poorly modeled regimes) can be treated with a Gaussian
mixture model, and a noise model is included to account for
systematically underestimated variance. Combining these phenomena into a
scalar-justified, quantitative model permits precise inferences with
credible uncertainties on noisy data. I describe the common model
features, the implementation details, and the default behavior, which is
balanced to be suitable for most astronomical applications. Using a
forward model on low-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of
M67 stars reveals atomic diffusion processes on the order of 0.05 dex,
previously only measurable with differential analysis techniques in
high-resolution spectra. sick is easy to use, well-tested, and freely
available online through GitHub under the MIT license.

without the addition of complementary spectroscopy. Among existing

largest overlap with TGAS ({\gsim}200,000 stars). We present a
data-driven re-analysis of 520,781 RAVE spectra using The Cannon. For
red giants, we build our model using high-fidelity APOGEE stellar
parameters and abundances for stars that overlap with RAVE. For main
sequence and sub-giant stars, our model uses stellar parameters from the
K2/EPIC. We derive and validate effective temperature T $_{eff}$,
surface gravity log g, and chemical abundances of up to seven elements
(O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe, and Ni). We report a total of 1,685,851
elemental abundances with a typical precision of 0.07 dex, a substantial

logg, and 15 abundances: C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn,
Fe, Ni) and the model is non-linear in its response to abundance and
parameter changes. We adopt ideas from compressed sensing to limit
overall model complexity while retaining model freedom. The model is
trained with a set of 12,681 red-giant stars with high signal-to-noise
spectroscopic observations and stellar parameters and abundances taken
from the APOGEE Survey. We find that we can successfully train and use a
model with 17 stellar labels. Validation shows that the model does a
good job of inferring all 17 labels (typical abundance precision is 0.04
dex), even when we degrade the signal-to-noise by discarding \~{}50\% of the
observing time. The model dependencies make sense: the spectral
derivatives with respect to abundances correlate with known atomic
lines, and we identify elements belonging to atomic lines that were
previously unknown. We recover (anti-)correlations in abundance labels
for globular cluster stars, consistent with the literature. However we
find the intrinsic spread in globular cluster abundances is 3--4 times
smaller than previously reported. We deliver 17 labels with associated
errors for 87,563 red giant stars, as well as open-source code to extend
this work to other spectroscopic surveys.

which includes the first nine Li-rich giant stars known towards the
CoRoT fields. Most of our Li-rich giants have near-solar metallicities
and stellar parameters consistent with being before the luminosity bump.
This is difficult to reconcile with deep mixing models proposed to
explain lithium enrichment, because these models can only operate at
later evolutionary stages: at or past the luminosity bump. In an effort
to shed light on the Li-rich phenomenon, we highlight recent evidence of
the tidal destruction of close-in hot Jupiters at the sub-giant phase.
We note that when coupled with models of planet accretion, the observed
destruction of hot Jupiters actually predicts the existence of Li-rich
giant stars, and suggests that Li-rich stars should be found early on
the giant branch and occur more frequently with increasing metallicity.
A comprehensive review of all known Li-rich giant stars reveals that
this scenario is consistent with the data. However, more evolved or
metal-poor stars are less likely to host close-in giant planets,
implying that their Li-rich origin requires an alternative explanation,
likely related to mixing scenarios rather than external phenomena.

reassessment of the Oosterhoff dichotomy is presented, which provides
unprecedented detail regarding its origin and systematics. We show that
the Oosterhoff dichotomy and the distribution of globular clusters in
the HB morphology-metallicity plane both exclude, with high statistical
significance, the possibility that the Galactic halo may have formed
from the accretion of dwarf galaxies resembling present-day Milky Way
satellites such as Fornax, Sagittarius, and the LMC{\mdash}an argument
which, due to its strong reliance on the ancient RR Lyrae stars, is
essentially independent of the chemical evolution of these systems after
the very earliest epochs in the Galaxy{\rsquo}s history. Convenient
analytical fits to isochrones in the HB type-[Fe/H] plane are also
provided. In this sense, a rediscussion of the second-parameter problem
is also presented, focusing on the cases of NGC 288/NGC 362, M13/M3, the
extreme outer-halo globular clusters with predominantly red HBs, and the
metal-rich globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. The recently revived
possibility that the helium abundance may play an important role as a
second parameter is also addressed, and possible constraints on this
scenario discussed. We critically discuss the possibility that the
observed properties of HB stars in NGC 6388 and NGC 6441 might be
accounted for if these clusters possess a relatively minor population of
helium-enriched stars. A technique is proposed to estimate the HB types
of extragalactic globular clusters on the basis of integrated far-UV
photometry. The importance of bright type II Cepheids as tracers of
faint blue HB stars in distant systems is also emphasized. The
relationship between the absolute V magnitude of the HB at the RR Lyrae
level and metallicity, as obtained on the basis of trigonometric
parallax measurements for the star RR Lyr, is also revisited. Taking
into due account the evolutionary status of RR Lyr, the derived relation
implies a true distance modulus to the LMC of
(m-M)$_{0}$=18.44{\plusmn}0.11. Techniques providing discrepant
slopes and zero points for the M $_{ V }$(RRL)-[Fe/H] relation are
briefly discussed. We provide a convenient analytical fit to theoretical
model predictions for the period change rates of RR Lyrae stars in
globular clusters, and compare the model results with the available
data. Finally, the conductive opacities used in evolutionary
calculations of low-mass stars are also investigated.

lower maximum-light velocities and typically lower peak magnitudes. In
our scenario, the progenitors of the SNe Iax are very massive white
dwarfs, possibly hybrid C+O+Ne white dwarfs; due to the accretion from a

central carbon deflagration, but the deflagration is quenched when it

predicts a spread in [Mn/Fe] in the ISM medium at low metallicity and -
at the same time - a decrease of the [alpha/Fe] elements, as in the

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Recently, new sub-classes of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were
discovered, including SNe Iax. The suggested progenitors of SNe Iax are
relatively massive, possibly hybrid C+O+Ne white dwarfs, which can cause
white dwarf winds at low metallicities. There is another class that can
potentially occur at low or zero metallicities; sub-Chandrasekhar mass
explosions in single and/or double degenerate systems of standard C+O
white dwarfs. These explosions have different nucleosynthesis yields
compared to the normal, Chandrasekhar mass explosions. <BR /> Aims: We
test these SN Ia channels using their characteristic chemical
signatures. <BR /> Methods: The two sub-classes of SNe Ia are expected
to be rarer than normal SNe Ia and do not affect the chemical evolution
in the solar neighbourhood; however, because of the shorter delay time
and/or weaker metallicity dependence, they could influence the evolution
of metal-poor systems. Therefore, we have included both in our
stochastic chemical evolution model for the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa
Minor. <BR /> Results: The model predicts a butterfly-shape spread in
[Mn/Fe] in the interstellar medium at low metallicity and - at the same
time - a decrease of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios at lower [Fe/H] than in the
solar neighbourhood, both of which are consistent with the observed
abundances in stars of Ursa Minor. <BR /> Conclusions: The surprising
agreement between our models and available observations provides a
strong indication of the origins of these new sub-classes of SNe Ia.
This outcome requires confirmation by future abundance measurements of
manganese in stars of other satellite galaxies of our Milky Way. It will
be vital for this project to measure not the most extreme metal-poor
tail, as more commonly happens, but the opposite; the metal-rich end of

reactions (on heavy elements) on the s-process nucleosynthesis in
low-mass stars and massive stars using a Monte-Carlo based approach. We
performed extensive nuclear reaction network calculations that include
newly evaluated temperature-dependent upper and lower limits for the
individual reaction rates. We found beta-decay rate uncertainties affect
only a few nuclei near s-process branchings, whereas most of the
uncertainty in the final abundances is caused by uncertainties in the
neutron capture rates. We suggest a list of uncertain rates as
candidates for improved measurement by future experiments.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. We have recently investigated the origin of chemical signatures
observed in Galactic halo stars by means of a stochastic chemical
evolution model. We found that rotating massive stars are a promising
way to explain several signatures observed in these fossil stars. <BR />
Aims: We discuss how the extremely metal-poor halo star TYC 8442-1036-1,
for which we have now obtained detailed abundances from VLT-UVES
spectra, fits into the framework of our previous work. <BR /> Methods:
We applied a standard one-dimensional (1D) LTE analysis to the spectrum
of this star. We measured the abundances of 14 chemical elements; we
computed the abundances for Na, Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, and
Zn using equivalent widths; we obtained the abundances for C, Sr, and Ba
by means of synthetic spectra generated by MOOG. <BR /> Results: We find
an abundance of [Fe/H] = -3.5 {\plusmn}0.13 dex based on our
high-resolution spectrum; this points to an iron content that is lower
by a factor of three (0.5 dex) compared to that obtained by a
low-resolution spectrum. The star has a [C/Fe] = 0.4 dex, and it is not
carbon enhanced like most of the stars at this metallicity. Moreover,
this star lies in the plane [Ba/Fe] versus [Fe/H] in a relatively
unusual position, shared by a few other Galactic halo stars, which is
only marginally explained by our past results. <BR /> Conclusions: The
comparison of the model results with the chemical abundance
characteristics of this group of stars can be improved if we consider in
our model the presence of faint supernovae coupled with rotating massive
stars. These results seem to imply that rotating massive stars and faint
supernovae scenarios are complementary to each other, and are both
required in order to match the observed chemistry of the earliest phases
of the chemical enrichment of the Universe.

  Abstract                 = {{In the present paper, we introduce a two-component model of the Galactic
disk to investigate its chemical evolution. It is assumed that the
formation of the thick and thin disks occurs in two main accretion
episodes with both infall rates being Gaussian. Both the pre-thin and
post-thin scenarios for the formation of the thick disk are considered.
The best fit is obtained through chi (2) -test between the models and
the new observed metallicity distribution function of G dwarfs in the
solar neighbourhood (Hou et al. 1998). Our results show that, the
predictions of both the pre-thin and post-thin model agree well with the
new observed G-dwarf metallicity distribution, i.e., it is difficult to
conclude which one is better when based on current observational
constraints. However, the present-day local density of the thick disk,
required for the pre-thin model to get the best fit, is larger than most
of results from star counts, yet this disagreement does not exist for
the post-thin model. From this point of view, it would seem that the
post-thin model is more viable. Finally, other comparisons between model
predictions and observations are given.

are excited and intrinsically damped by turbulence in the outermost
layers of the convective envelopes. In this review we discuss the
current state of the field, with a particular emphasis on recent
advances provided by the Kepler and COROT (Convection, Rotation {\amp}
Planetary Transits) space missions and the wider significance to
astronomy of the results from asteroseismology, such as stellar
populations studies and exoplanet studies.

  Abstract                 = {{We have developed a novel technique based on a clustering algorithm
which searches for kinematically-and-chemically-clustered stars in the
APOGEE DR12 Cannon data. As compared to classical chemical tagging, the
kinematic information included in our methodology allows us to identify
stars that are members of known globular clusters with greater
confidence. Our methodology reduces the dimensionality of clustering in
the chemical space according to anti-correlations found in the optical
spectra between the elements Al and Mg, Na and O, and C and N in
globular clusters. Our algorithm identifies globular clusters without a
priori knowledge of their locations in the sky. Thus, not only does this
technique promise to discover new globular clusters, but it also allows
us to search for unusual stars in the halo to identify new streams of
kinematically--and--chemically--clustered stars.

new models of massive stars, from the pre-main-sequence phase to the
central carbon ignition. We consider a broad range of metallicities,
0.0001 {\le} Z {\le} 0.04 and initial masses up to M$_{ini}$ = 350
M$_{&sun;}$. The main difference with respect to our previous
models of massive stars is the adoption of a recent formalizm accounting
for the mass-loss enhancement when the ratio of the stellar to the
Eddington luminosity, {$\Gamma$}$_{e}$, approaches unity. With this
new formalizm, the models are able to reproduce the Humphreys-Davidson
limit observed in the Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud
colour-magnitude diagrams, without an ad hoc mass-loss enhancement. We
also follow the predictions of recent wind models indicating that the
metallicity dependence of the mass-loss rates becomes shallower when
{$\Gamma$}$_{e}$ approaches unity. We thus find that the more massive
stars may suffer from substantial mass-loss even at low metallicity. We
also predict that the Humphreys-Davidson limit should become brighter at
decreasing metallicity. We supplement the evolutionary tracks with new
tables of theoretical bolometric corrections, useful to compare tracks
and isochrones with the observations. For this purpose, we homogenize
existing stellar atmosphere libraries of hot and cool stars (Potsdam
Wolf-Rayet, ATLAS9 and PHOENIX) and we add, where needed, new atmosphere
models computed with WM-BASIC. The mass, age and metallicity grids are
fully adequate to perform detailed investigations of the properties of
very young stellar systems, both in local and distant galaxies. The new
tracks supersede the previous old PADOVA models of massive stars.

  Abstract                 = {{Many stellar models present difficulties in reproducing basic
observational relations of very low mass stars (VLMS), including the
mass-radius relation and the optical colour-magnitudes of cool dwarfs.
Here, we improve PARSEC (PAdova-TRieste Stellar Evolution Code) models
on these points. We implement the T- {$\tau$} relations from PHOENIX
BT-Settl model atmospheres as the outer boundary conditions in the
PARSEC code, finding that this change alone reduces the discrepancy in
the mass-radius relation from 8 to 5 per cent. We compare the models
with multiband photometry of clusters Praesepe and M67, showing that the
use of T- {$\tau$} relations clearly improves the description of the
optical colours and magnitudes. But anyway, using both Kurucz and
PHOENIX model spectra, model colours are still systematically fainter
and bluer than the observations. We then apply a shift to the above T-
{$\tau$} relations, increasing from 0 at T$_{eff}$ = 4730 K to
{\tilde}14 per cent at T$_{eff}$ = 3160 K, to reproduce the
observed mass-radius relation of dwarf stars. Taking this experiment as
a calibration of the T- {$\tau$} relations, we can reproduce the optical
and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of low-mass stars in the old
metal-poor globular clusters NGC 6397 and 47 Tuc, and in the
intermediate-age and young solar-metallicity open clusters M67 and
Praesepe. Thus, we extend PARSEC models using this calibration,
providing VLMS models more suitable for the lower main-sequence stars
over a wide range of metallicities and wavelengths. Both sets of models
are available on PARSEC webpage.

existence of a N/O abundance gradient along the Galactic disk, such a

computed the abundance gradient of N/O for the MW. In our formalist the
MW formed out of two-infall episodes, one forming the halo/thick disk on
a short timescale and a second one forming the thin disk on a much
longer timescale. Moreover, in our framework the thin disk formed
inside-out (see details in [3]). Here we show that a negative gradient
is predicted for N/O once we adopt stellar yields where rotation is
taken into account (see Fig.1 - thick line). We point out that although
[5] did not include formally the hot bottom burning (HBB), models
computed with their stellar yields are still compatible with the

  Abstract                 = {{Galactic Archeology is a coined term to describe the fact that the Milky
Way's history is encoded both in the amounts of various chemical
elements seen in the spectra of stellar atmospheres (abundances), and in
stellar motions. One of the pillars of Galactic Archaeology is the use
of stellar abundance ratios as an indirect age estimator, which although
imprecise, has been proved useful in providing relative ages between the
different galactic components. The lack of more precise age
determination for large samples of field stars is one of the main
reasons why different scenarios for the formation of our Galaxy can
still be accommodated to current observational constraints, thus
preventing a clear picture of the Milky Way's assembling history.
Another difficulty is that most of the available information (especially
on ages) has been confined to a region close to the Sun. These two main
obstacles can now start to be overcome thanks to a) large spectroscopic
and photometric surveys covering larger portions of the Milky Way, and
b) the combination of the photometric and spectroscopic information with
that coming from asteroseismology. The latter promises a breakthrough in
the field of Galactic Archaeology, as it brings the opportunity to, for
the first time, measure ages for large samples of distant field giant
stars, which cover a large age-baseline. When combining this information
with that soon available from Gaia, the field of Galactic Archaeology
will be shaken and modelers will certainly have less flexibility in
finding models that comply to these precious new observational
constraints. The goal of these short lectures is to put Asteroseismology
in the context of Galactic Archaeology.

  Abstract                 = {{Many are the proposed scenarios for the formation of the thick disk of
the Milky Way, going from the merger with smaller galaxies to fast gas
accretion in the early Universe. Crucial information on which was the
dominant mechanism for the formation of the thick disk and other
Galactic components is encoded in the chemical properties of their
stars. By comparing the chemical properties of bulge, thick and thin
disk stars one can address the question of which, among the competing
processes of dissipation, satellite accretion and radial migration, play
the dominant role in the formation of the different Galactic components.
The main difficulty at present is that current data samples suffer from
selection biases. Gaia shall bring a quantum leap to the solution of
this problem, by providing fiducial samples of the different galactic
components with both, chemical and full kinematic information. To pave
the road for Gaia, theoretical models need to be improved by taking into
account both chemistry and dynamical aspects. A work of this kind is
underway in Geneva Observatory.

much more slowly and {\lsquo}inside-out{\rsquo} during a second
independent infall episode. We explored the effects of a threshold in
the star formation process, during both the halo and disk phases. In the
comparison between model predictions and available data, we have focused
our attention on abundance gradients as well as gas, stellar and star
formation rate distributions along the disk. We suggest that the
mechanism for the formation of the halo leaves detectable imprints on
the chemical properties of the outer regions of the disk, whereas the
evolution of the halo and the inner disk are almost completely
disentangled. This is due to the fact that the halo and disk densities
are comparable at large Galactocentric distances and therefore the gas
lost from the halo can substantially contribute to building up the outer
disk. We predict that the abundance gradients along the Galactic disk
have increased in time during the first billion years of the disk
evolution and remained almost constant in the last \~{}5Gyrs.

  Abstract                 = {{Galactic Archaeology has recently been challenged by the fact that stars
observed now in a certain location are not necessarily born there, but
could have been kicked out from their birth places by different internal
and/or external processes. We have made one of the first attempts to
quantify how important stellar mixing could be in the case of our
Galaxy, and how much of the original chemodynamical correlations would
have been destroyed by such processes. Our unique approach has allowed
us to conclude that although stellar mixing does take place in our
Galaxy, many of the main relations between chemistry and age suggested
by pure chemical evolution models are still generally valid. However,
stringent constraints can be obtained only when stellar ages will be
known for a large number of field stars. This is certainly one of the
goals of Gaia, but in the meantime it has been shown that
Asteroseismology can also provide a way to estimate ages of giants, even
at large distances from the Sun. Here we present the first results
obtained with a sample of CoRoT stars that have APOGEE spectra, in the
framework of the CoRoGEE collaboration. The results coming from this
still very recent approach (i.e. asteroseismology of Galactic
populations) reveals that we might be on the right track in terms of
quantifying radial mixing, but these results also suggest the chemical
enrichment of the Galactic disk(s) to have been more complex than
previously envisaged. Intriguingly, we find that the use of
[{$\alpha$}/Fe]-ratios as proxy for age, although generally valid, breaks
down for some stars.

  Abstract                 = {{We report the discovery of a group of apparently young CoRoT red-giant
stars exhibiting enhanced [{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundance ratios (as determined
from APOGEE spectra) with respect to solar values. Their existence is
not explained bystandard chemical evolution models of the Milky Way, and
shows that the chemical-enrichment history of the Galactic disc is more
complex. We find similar stars in previously published samples for which
isochrone-ages could be reliably obtained, although in smaller relative
numbers. This might explain why these stars have not previously received
attention. The young [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich stars are much more numerous in
the CoRoT-APOGEE (CoRoGEE) inner-field sample than in any other
high-resolution sample available at present because only CoRoGEE can
explore the inner-disc regions and provide ages for its field stars. The
kinematic properties of the young [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich stars are not
clearly thick-disc like, despite their rather large distances from the
Galactic mid-plane. Our tentative interpretation of these and previous
intriguing observations in the Milky Way is that these stars were formed
close to the end of the Galactic bar, near corotation - a region where
gas can be kept inert for longer times than in other regions that are
more frequently shocked by the passage of spiral arms. Moreover, this is
where the mass return from older inner-disc stellar generations is
expected to be highest (according to an inside-out disc-formation
scenario), which additionally dilutes the in-situ gas. Other
possibilities to explain these observations (e.g., a recent
gas-accretion event) are also discussed.

imprints left by the first stars have focused on the most metal-poor
(and probably oldest) stars found in the MW halo. Very metal-poor stars
were also found in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, which are intriguing
dark-matter dominated objects with very low average metallicities.
Studies based on the chemical and kinematic properties of stars in the
different MW components have shown that not only the halo, but also the
bulge is a potential host of some of the oldest stars in our Galaxy. The
oldest Globular Cluster of the MW is located in the Bulge (Barbuy et al.
2009), and recently it has been possible to measure ages for microlensed
dwarf stars in the Bulge, finding very old objects. These both
observational results show that the oldest objects in the Bulge have
metallicities around [Fe/H] = -1, hence offering a new window on the
First Stars (Chiappini et al. 2011). Indeed, the correspondence between
age and metallicity is strongly dependent on the star formation history
of the particular studied component, and this suggestion has far
reaching implications.What I would like to show in my talk is the
importance Planetary Nebulae can play in this hot field. I will show
that by studying the PNe metallicity bulge distribution one can
highlight the ''old Bulge'' component. Once this important observational
constraint is used to guide chemical evolution models of the oldest
bulge population, one can use these models to look for imprints of the
first stars in the bulge. A comparison with what we have found so far
for the halo, and the new insights we can get by adding the Galactic
Bulge in this interesting topic will be shown and discussed.

and they provided the Universe with the first elements heavier than
helium (`metals'), which were incorporated into low-mass stars that have
survived to the present. Eight stars in the oldest globular cluster in
the Galaxy, NGC6522, were found to have surface abundances consistent
with the gas from which they formed being enriched by massive stars
(that is, with higher {$\alpha$}-element/Fe and Eu/Fe ratios than those of
the Sun). However, the same stars have anomalously high abundances of Ba
and La with respect to Fe, which usually arises through nucleosynthesis
in low-mass stars (via the slow-neutron-capture process, or s-process).
Recent theory suggests that metal-poor fast-rotating massive stars are
able to boost the s-process yields by up to four orders of magnitude,
which might provide a solution to this contradiction. Here we report a
reanalysis of the earlier spectra, which reveals that Y and Sr are also
overabundant with respect to Fe, showing a large scatter similar to that
observed in extremely metal-poor stars, whereas C abundances are not
enhanced. This pattern is best explained as originating in metal-poor
fast-rotating massive stars, which might point to a common property of
the first stellar generations and even of the `first stars'.

values, although they make use of very different assumptions. The
investigation of the temporal behaviour of these metallicity gradients
can contribute to clarify the problem of the non-uniqueness of CEMs for
the Galaxy. As an example the authors have the opposite results obtained
by the models of Tosi (1995) and Ferrini et al. (1994). With a
simplified chemical evolution model they investigate some of the
fundamental processes responsible for the formation and evolution of the
radial abundance gradients in the galactic disk. Preliminary numerical
results for the radial variation of the metallicity at three different
epochs show that these gradients depend both on time and position in the
disk. They seem to be steeper in the inner regions than in the outer
parts and tend to increase with time for galactocentric distances
smaller than solar, being constant for greater distances.

dominant processes involved in its formation and evolution, is now a
powerful method thanks to the large recently completed and ongoing
spectroscopic surveys. It is now important to ask the right questions
when analyzing and interpreting the information contained in these rich
datasets. To this aim, we have developed a chemodynamical model for the
Milky Way that provides quantitative predictions to be compared with the
chemo-kinematical properties extracted from the stellar spectra. Three
key parameters are needed to make the comparison between data and model
predictions useful in order to advance in the field, namely: precise
proper-motions, distances and ages. The uncertainties involved in the
estimate of ages and distances for field stars are currently the main
obstacles in the Galactic Archaeology method. Two important developments
might change this situation in the near future: asteroseismology and the
now launched Gaia. When combined with the large datasets from surveys
like RAVE, SEGUE, LAMOST, Gaia-ESO, APOGEE, HERMES and the future 4MOST
we will have the basic ingredients for the reconstruction of the MW
history in hands. In the light of these observational advances, the
development of detailed chemo-dynamical models tailored to the Milky Way
is urgently needed in the field. Here we show the steps we have taken,
both in terms of data analysis and modelling. The examples shown here
illustrate how powerful can the Galactic Archaeology method become once
ages and distances are known with better precision than what is
currently feasible.

  Abstract                 = {{We present a new approach for studying the chemodynamical evolution of
the Milky Way, which combines a thin disk chemical evolution model with
the dynamics from N-body simulation of a galaxy with properties similar
to those of our Galaxy. A cosmological re-simulation is used as a
surrogate in order to extract {\tilde}11 Gyrs of self-consistent
dynamical evolution. We are then in a position to quantify the impact of
radial migration at the Solar Vicinity. We find that the distribution of
birth radii, r0, of stars ending up in a solar neighborhood-like
location after {\tilde}11 Gyr of evolution peaks around r0 = 6 kpc due to
radial migration. A wide range of birth radii is seen for different age
groups. The strongest effect from radial migration is found for the
oldest stars and it is connected to an early merger phase typical from
cosmological simulations. We find that while the low-end in our
simulated solar vicinity metallicity distribution is composed by stars
with a wide range of birth radii, the tail at larger metallicities (0.25
{\lt}[Fe/H]{\lt} 0.6) results almost exclusively from stars with 3 {\lt}
r0{\lt} 5 kpc. This is the region just inside the bar's corotation (CR),
which is where the strongest outward radial migration occurs. The
fraction of stars in this tail can, therefore, be related to the bar's
dynamical properties, such as its strength, pattern speed and time
evolution/formation. We show that one of the main observational
constraints of this kind of models is the time variation of the
abundance gradients in the disk. The most important outcome of our
chemodynamical model is that, although we used only a thin-disc chemical
evolution model, the oldest stars that are now in the solar vicinity
show several of the properties usually attributed to the Galactic thick
disc. In other words, in our model the MW ''thick disc'' emerges naturally
from stars migrating from the inner disc very early on due to strong
merger activity in the first couple of Gyr of disc formation, followed
by further radial migration driven by the bar and spirals at later
times. These results will be extended to other radius bins and more
chemical elements in order to provide testable predictions once more
precise information on ages and distances would become available (with
Gaia, asteroseismology and future surveys such as 4MOST).

Our results show that, when adopting detailed yields taking into account
the extra-mixing process in low and intermediate mass stars, the problem
of the overproduction of $^{3}$He by the chemical evolution models
is solved. The predicted distribution of $^{3}$He along the disk
is also in agreement with the observations. We also predict the
distributions of D/H, D/O and D/N along the disk, in particular D
abundances close to the primordial value are predicted in the outer
regions of the Galaxy. The predicted D/H, D/O and D/N abundances in the
local interstellar medium are in agreement with the mean values observed
by the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer mission, although a large
spread in the D abundance is present in the data. Finally, by means of
our chemical evolution model, we can constrain the primordial value of
the deuterium abundance, and we find a value of (D/H)$_{p}$ {\lt}\~{}

  Abstract                 = {{The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) has
amassed the largest ever collection of multi-epoch, high-resolution
(R{\tilde}22,500), H-band spectra for B-type emission line (Be) stars.
These stars were targeted by APOGEE as telluric standard stars and
subsequently identified via visual inspection as Be stars based on H i
Brackett series emission or shell absorption in addition to otherwise
smooth continua and occasionally non-hydrogen emission features. The
128/238 APOGEE Be stars for which emission had never previously been
reported serve to increase the total number of known Be stars by
{\tilde}6\%. Because the H band is relatively unexplored compared to other
wavelength regimes, we focus here on identification of the H-band lines
and analysis of the emission peak velocity separations
({$\Delta$}$\{$$\{$v$\}$$_{p}$$\}$) and emission peak intensity ratios (V/R) of
the usually double-peaked H i and non-hydrogen emission lines. H i Br11
emission is found to preferentially form in the circumstellar disks at
an average distance of {\tilde}2.2 stellar radii. Increasing
{$\Delta$}$\{$$\{$v$\}$$_{p}$$\}$ toward the weaker Br12-Br20 lines suggests
these lines are formed interior to Br11. By contrast, the observed IR Fe
ii emission lines present evidence of having significantly larger
formation radii; distinctive phase lags between IR Fe ii and H i
Brackett emission lines further supports that these species arise from
different radii in Be disks. Several emission lines have been identified
for the first time including C i 16895, a prominent feature in the
spectra for almost a fifth of the sample and, as inferred from
relatively large {$\Delta$}$\{$$\{$v$\}$$_{p}$$\}$ compared to the Br11-Br20, a
tracer of the inner regions of Be disks. Emission lines at 15760 {\AA}
and 16781 {\AA} remain unidentified, but usually appear along with and
always have similar line profile morphology to Fe ii 16878. Unlike the
typical metallic lines observed for Be stars in the optical, the H-band
metallic lines, such as Fe ii 16878, never exhibit any evidence of shell
absorption, even when the H i lines are clearly shell-dominated. The
first known example of a quasi-triple-peaked Br11 line profile is
reported for HD 253659, one of several stars exhibiting intra- and/or
extra-species V/R and radial velocity variation within individual
spectra. Br11 profiles are presented for all discussed stars, as are
full APOGEE spectra for a portion of the sample.

patrol field offered by the Nasmyth focus at the VLT. The total
wavelength coverage is 0.8{$\mu$}m-1.8{$\mu$}m and two resolution modes:
medium resolution and high resolution. In the medium resolution mode
(R\~{}4,000-6,000) the entire wavelength range 0.8{$\mu$}m-1.8{$\mu$}m is
observed simultaneously, while the high resolution mode covers
simultaneously three selected spectral regions: one around the CaII
triplet (at R\~{}8,000) to measure radial velocities, and two regions at
R\~{}20,000 one in the J-band and one in the H-band, for detailed
measurements of chemical abundances. The grasp of the 8.2m Very Large
Telescope (VLT) combined with the large multiplex and wavelength
coverage of MOONS - extending into the near-IR - will provide the
observational power necessary to study galaxy formation and evolution
over the entire history of the Universe, from our Milky Way, through the
redshift desert and up to the epoch of re-ionization at z$\lt$8-9. At the
same time, the high spectral resolution mode will allow astronomers to
study chemical abundances of stars in our Galaxy, in particular in the
highly obscured regions of the Bulge, and provide the necessary
follow-up of the Gaia mission. Such characteristics and versatility make
MOONS the long-awaited workhorse near-IR MOS for the VLT, which will
perfectly complement optical spectroscopy performed by FLAMES and VIMOS.

constant between 2 and 8 Gyr, and it becomes significantly lower for the

reveals that the intrinsic dispersion in metallicity increases steadily

with respect to the main body of Sgr, (2) estimates of the FWHM along
the los, and (3) estimates of the local density, for each detected
substructure. In the range 255{\deg} {\lt}\~{} {$\Lambda$} {\lt}\~{} 290{\deg} we
cleanly and continuously trace various coherent structures that can be
ascribed to the Stream, in particular: the well-known northern portion
of the leading arm, running from d \~{}= 43 kpc at {$\Lambda$} \~{}= 290{\deg} to
d \~{}= 30 kpc at {$\Lambda$} \~{}= 255{\deg}, and a more nearby coherent series
of detections lying at a constant distance d \~{}= 25 kpc, that can be
identified with a wrap of the trailing arm. The latter structure,
predicted by several models of the disruption of Sgr dSph, was never
traced before; comparison with existing models indicates that the
difference in distance between these portions of the leading and
trailing arms may provide a powerful tool to discriminate between
theoretical models assuming different shapes of the Galactic potential.
A further, more distant wrap in the same portion of the sky is detected
only along a couple of los. For {$\Lambda$} {\lt}\~{} 255{\deg} the detected
structures are more complex and less easily interpreted. We are
confident of being able to trace the continuation of the leading arm
down to {$\Lambda$} \~{}= 220{\deg} and d \~{}= 20 kpc the trailing arm is seen up
to {$\Lambda$} \~{}= 240{\deg} where it is replaced by more distant structures.
Possible detections of more nearby wraps and of the Virgo Stellar Stream
are also discussed. These measured properties provide a coherent set of
observational constraints for the next generation of theoretical models
of the disruption of Sgr.

periods associated with the rotational modulation, oscillations, and
variability of stars located in the CoRoT fields, we are conducting a
spectroscopic survey for stars located in the fields already observed by
the satellite. These observations allow us to compute physical and
chemical parameters for our stellar sample. Method: Using spectroscopic
observations obtained with UVES/VLT and Hydra/Blanco, and based on
standard analysis techniques, we computed physical and chemical
parameters (\$T\_$\{$$\backslash$rm$\{$eff$\}$$\}$\$, \$$\backslash$log $\backslash$,(g)\$, \$$\backslash$rm$\{$[Fe/H]$\}$\$, \$v\_$\{$$\backslash$rm$\{$mic$\}$$\}$\$,
\$v\_$\{$$\backslash$rm$\{$rad$\}$$\}$\$, \$v $\backslash$sin $\backslash$,(i)\$, and \$A($\backslash$rm$\{$Li$\}$)\$) for a large sample of
CoRoT targets. Results: We provide physical and chemical parameters for
a sample comprised of 138 CoRoT targets. Our analysis shows the stars in
our sample are located in different evolutionary stages, ranging from
the main sequence to the red giant branch, and range in spectral type
from F to K. The physical and chemical properties for the stellar sample
are in agreement with typical values reported for FGK stars. However, we
report three stars presenting abnormal lithium behavior in the CoRoT
fields. These parameters allow us to properly characterize the intrinsic
properties of the stars in these fields. Our results reveal important
differences in the distributions of metallicity, \$T\_$\{$$\backslash$rm eff$\}$\$, and
evolutionary status for stars belonging to different CoRoT fields, in
agreement with results obtained independently from ground-based
photometric surveys. Conclusions: Our spectroscopic catalog, by
providing much-needed spectroscopic information for a large sample of
CoRoT targets, will be of key importance for the successful
accomplishment of several different programs related to the CoRoT
mission, thus it will help further boost the scientific return
associated with this space mission.

unconstrained simulations, we cover a sufficient volume to compare these
galaxies{\rsquo} environmental densities ranging from the field to that
of the Local Group (LG). This is particularly relevant as it has been
shown that, quite generally, galaxy properties depend intimately upon
their environment, most prominently when galaxies in clusters are
compared to those in the field. For galaxies in loose groups such as the
LG, however, environmental effects have been less clear. We consider the
galaxy{\rsquo}s environmental density in spheres of 1200 kpc (comoving)
and find that while environment does not appear to directly affect
morphology, there is a positive trend with SFRs. This enhancement in
star formation occurs systematically for galaxies in higher density
environments, regardless whether they are part of the LG or in
filaments. Our simulations suggest that the richer environment at
megaparsec scales may help replenish the star-forming gas, allowing
higher specific SFRs in galaxies such as the MW.

  Abstract                 = {{The envelope of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars
undergoing periodic third dredge-up (TDU) episodes is enriched in both
light and heavy elements, the ashes of a complex internal
nucleosynthesis involving p, {$\alpha$}, and n captures over hundreds of
stable and unstable isotopes. In this paper, new models of low-mass AGB
stars (2 M $_{sun}$), with metallicity ranging between Z = 0.0138
(the solar one) and Z = 0.0001, are presented. Main features are (1) a
full nuclear network (from H to Bi) coupled to the stellar evolution
code, (2) a mass loss-period-luminosity relation, based on available
data for long-period variables, and (3) molecular and atomic opacities
for C- and/or N-enhanced mixtures, appropriate for the chemical
modifications of the envelope caused by the TDU. For each model, a
detailed description of the physical and chemical evolutions is
presented; moreover, we present a uniform set of yields, comprehensive
of all chemical species (from hydrogen to bismuth). The main
nucleosynthesis site is the thin $^{13}$C pocket, which forms in
the core-envelope transition region after each TDU episode. The
formation of this $^{13}$C pocket is the principal by-product of
the introduction of a new algorithm, which shapes the velocity profile
of convective elements at the inner border of the convective envelope:
both the physical grounds and the calibration of the algorithm are
discussed in detail. We find that the pockets shrink (in mass) as the
star climbs the AGB, so that the first pockets, the largest ones, leave
the major imprint on the overall nucleosynthesis. Neutrons are released
by the $^{13}$C({$\alpha$}, n)$^{16}$O reaction during the
interpulse phase in radiative conditions, when temperatures within the
pockets attain T \~{} 1.0 {\times} 10$^{8}$ K, with typical densities
of (10$^{6}$-10$^{7}$) neutrons cm$^{-3}$. Exceptions
are found, as in the case of the first pocket of the metal-rich models
(Z = 0.0138, Z = 0.006 and Z = 0.003), where the $^{13}$C is only
partially burned during the interpulse: the surviving part is ingested
in the convective zone generated by the subsequent thermal pulse (TP)
and then burned at T \~{} 1.5 {\times} 10$^{8}$ K, thus producing
larger neutron densities (up to 10$^{11}$ neutrons
cm$^{-3}$). An additional neutron exposure, caused by the
$^{22}$Ne({$\alpha$}, n)$^{25}$Mg during the TPs, is marginally
activated at large Z, but becomes an important nucleosynthesis source at
low Z, when most of the $^{22}$Ne is primary. The final surface
compositions of the various models reflect the differences in the
initial iron-seed content and in the physical structure of AGB stars
belonging to different stellar populations. Thus, at large metallicities
the nucleosynthesis of light s-elements (Sr, Y, Zr) is favored, whilst,
decreasing the iron content, the overproduction of heavy s-elements (Ba,
La, Ce, Nd, Sm) and lead becomes progressively more important. At low
metallicities (Z = 0.0001) the main product is lead. The agreement with
the observed [hs/ls] index observed in intrinsic C stars at different
[Fe/H] is generally good. For the solar metallicity model, we found an
interesting overproduction of some radioactive isotopes, like
$^{60}$Fe, as a consequence of the anomalous first $^{13}$C
pocket. Finally, light elements (C, F, Ne, and Na) are enhanced at any
metallicity.

branch (AGB) stars (4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 M$_{&sun;}$) at different
metallicities (-2.15 {\le} [Fe/H] {\le} +0.15). This set integrates
the existing models for low-mass AGB stars (1.3 {\le} M/M$_{&sun;}$
{\le} 3.0) already included in the FRUITY database. We describe the
physical and chemical evolution of the computed models from the main
sequence up to the end of the AGB phase. Due to less efficient third
dredge up episodes, models with large core masses show modest surface
enhancements. This effect is due to the fact that the interpulse phases
are short and, therefore, thermal pulses (TPs) are weak. Moreover, the
high temperature at the base of the convective envelope prevents it from
deeply penetrating the underlying radiative layers. Depending on the
initial stellar mass, the heavy element nucleosynthesis is dominated by
different neutron sources. In particular, the s-process distributions of
the more massive models are dominated by the
$^{22}$Ne({$\alpha$},n)$^{25}$Mg reaction, which is efficiently
activated during TPs. At low metallicities, our models undergo hot
bottom burning and hot third dredge up. We compare our theoretical final
core masses to available white dwarf observations. Moreover, we quantify
the influence intermediate-mass models have on the carbon star
luminosity function. Finally, we present the upgrade of the FRUITY web
interface, which now also includes the physical quantities of the TP-AGB
phase for all of the models included in the database (ph-FRUITY).

  Abstract                 = {{Metallicity gradients provide strong constraints for understanding the
chemical evolution of the Galaxy. We report on radial abundance
gradients of Fe, Ni, Ca, Si, and Mg obtained from a sample of 304
red-giant members of 29 disk open clusters, mostly concentrated at
galactocentric distances between {\tilde} 8-15 kpc, but including two
open clusters in the outer disk. The observations are from the APOGEE
survey. The chemical abundances were derived automatically by the ASPCAP
pipeline and these are part of the SDSS III Data Release 12. The
gradients, obtained from least squares fits to the data, are relatively
flat, with slopes ranging from -0.026 to -0.033 dex kpc$^{-1}$ for
the {$\alpha$}-elements [O/H], [Ca/H], [Si/H], and [Mg/H], and -0.035 dex
kpc$^{-1}$ and -0.040 dex kpc$^{-1}$ for [Fe/H] and [Ni/H],
respectively. Our results are not at odds with the possibility that
metallicity ([Fe/H]) gradients are steeper in the inner disk
($\{$R\_GC{\tilde} 7$\}$-12 kpc) and flatter towards the outer disk. The open
cluster sample studied spans a significant range in age. When breaking
the sample into age bins, there is some indication that the younger open
cluster population in our sample (log age $\lt$ 8.7) has a flatter
metallicity gradient when compared with the gradients obtained from
older open clusters.

obtain a distance to the Galactic center of R $_{0}$ = 8.33
{\plusmn} 0.05 {\plusmn} 0.14 kpc. We find that the spatial distribution
of the RRL stars differs from the structures traced by the predominantly
metal-rich red clump (RC) stars. Unlike the RC stars, the RRL stars do
not trace a strong bar, but have a more spheroidal, centrally
concentrated distribution, showing only a slight elongation in its very
center. We find a hint of bimodality in the density distribution at high
southern latitudes (b $\lt$ -5{\deg}), which needs to be confirmed
by extending the areal coverage of the current census. The different
spatial distributions of the metal-rich and metal-poor stellar
populations suggest that the Milky Way has a composite bulge.

  Abstract                 = {{We present new accurate abundances for five neutron-capture elements (Y,
La, Ce, Nd, Eu) in 73 classical Cepheids located across the Galactic
thin disk. Individual abundances are based on high spectral resolution
(R \~{} 38 000) and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N \~{} 50-300) spectra
collected with UVES at ESO VLT for the DIONYSOS project. Taking into
account similar Cepheid abundances provided by our group (111 stars) and
available in the literature, we end up with a sample of 435 Cepheids
covering a broad range in iron abundances (-1.6 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ 0.6).
We found, via homogeneous individual distances and abundance scales,
well-defined gradients for the above elements. However, the slope of the
light s-process element (Y) is at least a factor of two steeper than the
slopes of heavy s- (La, Ce, Nd) and r- (Eu) process elements. The s-to-r
abundance ratio ([La/Eu]) of Cepheids shows a well-defined
anticorrelation with both Eu and Fe. On the other hand, Galactic field
stars attain an almost constant value and display a mild enhancement in
La only when they approach solar iron abundance. The [Y/Eu] ratio shows
slight evidence of a correlation with Eu and, in particular, with iron
abundance for field Galactic stars. We also investigated the s-process
index ([hs/ls]) and we found a well-defined anticorrelation, as
expected, between [La/Y] and iron abundance. Moreover, we found a strong
correlation between [La/Y] and [La/Fe] and, in particular, a clear
separation between Galactic and <ASTROBJ>Sagittarius</ASTROBJ> red
giants. Finally, the comparison between predictions for low-mass
asymptotic giant branch stars and the observed[La/Y] ratio indicate a
very good agreement over the entire metallicity range covered by
Cepheids. However, the observed spread at fixed iron content is larger
than predicted by current models.

photospheric parameters, mass, age, and the abundances of volatile (C,
N, and O) and refractory (Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Ba)
elements. Our sample contains 309 stars from the solar neighborhood (up
to the distance of 100 pc), out of which 140 are dwarfs, 29 are
subgiants, and 140 are giants. <BR /> Methods: The photospheric
parameters are derived from the equivalent widths of Fe i and Fe ii
lines. Masses and ages come from the interpolation in evolutionary
tracks and isochrones on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The abundance
determination is based on the equivalent widths of selected atomic lines
of the refractory elements and on the spectral synthesis of
C$_{2}$, CN, C i, O i, and Na i features. We apply a set of
statistical methods to analyze the abundances derived for the three
subsamples. <BR /> Results: Our results show that: i) giant stars
systematically exhibit underabundance in [C/Fe] and overabundance in
[N/Fe] and [Na/Fe] in comparison with dwarfs, a result that is normally
attributed to evolution-induced mixing processes in the envelope of
evolved stars; ii) for solar analogs alone, the abundance trends with
the condensation temperature of the elements are correlated with age and
anticorrelated with the surface gravity, which agrees with recent
studies; iii) as in the case of [Fe/H], dwarf stars with giant planets
are systematically enriched in [X/H] for all the analyzed elements,
except for O and Ba (the former due to limitations of statistics),
confirming previous findings in the literature that it is not only iron
that has an important relation with the planetary formation; and iv)
giant planet hosts are also significantly overabundant for the same
metallicity when the elements from Mg to Cu are combined.

having, on average, over-solar abundances ({\mlab}[X/H]{\mrab} = +0.26
dex), another with under-solar abundances ({\mlab} [X/H] {\mrab} = -0.24
dex), and two with intermediate values ({\mlab} [X/H] {\mrab} = -0.06 and
+0.06 dex) but with distinct chemical patterns. Stars sharing solar
metallicity, age, and Galactic orbit possibly have non-solar abundance
ratios, a possible effect either of chemical heterogeneity in their
natal clouds or migration. A trend of [Cu/Fe] with [Ba/Fe] seems to
exist, in agreement with previous claims in the literature, and maybe
also of [Sm/Fe] with [Ba/Fe]. No such correlation involving C, Na, Mn,
and Zn is observed. The [X/Fe] ratios of various elements show
significant correlations with age. [Mg/Fe], [Sc/Fe], and [Ti/Fe]
increase with age. [Mn/Fe] and [Cu/Fe] display a more complex behaviour,
first increasing towards younger stars up to the solar age, and then
decreasing, a result we interpret as possibly related to time-varying
yields of SN Ia and the weak s-process in massive stars. The steepest
negative age relation is due to [Ba/Fe], but only for stars younger than
the Sun, and a similar though less significant behaviour is seen for Zr,
Ce, and Nd. [Sr/Fe] and [Y/Fe] show a linearly increasing trend towards
younger stars. The [Cu/Ba] and [Sm/Ba] therefore decrease for younger
stars. We found that [Ba/Mg], [Ba/Zn], and [Sr,Y,Ba/Sm] increase but
only for stars younger than the Sun, whereas the [Sr/Mg], [Y/Mg],
[Sr/Zn], and [Y/Zn] ratios increase linearly towards younger stars over
the whole age range.

  Abstract                 = {{The distribution of stellar abundances along the Galactic disk is an
important constraint for models of chemical evolution and Galaxy
formation. In this study we derive radial gradients of C, N, O, Mg, Al,
and Si, as well as S, from abundance determinations in young OB stars.
Our database is composed of a sample of 69 members of 25 open clusters,
OB associations, and H II regions with Galactocentric distances between
4.7 and 13.2 kpc. An important feature of this abundance database is the
fact that the abundances were derived self-consistently in non-LTE using
a homogeneous set of stellar parameters. Such an uniform analysis is
expected to reduce the magnitude of random errors, as well as the
influence of systematics in the gradients defined by the abundance and
Galactocentric distance. The metallicity gradients obtained in this
study are, in general, flatter than the results from previous recent
abundance studies of early-type stars. The slopes are found to be
between -0.031 (for oxygen) and -0.052 dex kpc$^{-1}$ (for
magnesium). The gradients obtained for the studied elements are quite
similar, and if averaged they can be represented by a single slope of
-0.042+/-0.007dexkpc$^{-1}$. This value is generally consistent
with an overall flattening of the radial gradients with time.

  Abstract                 = {{The CoRoT faint stars channel observed about 163 600 targets to detect
transiting planetary companions. Because CoRoT targets are faint (11$\lt$
r $\lt$16) and close to the galactic plane, only a small subsample has
been observed spectroscopically. We describe the latest classification
scheme used to derive the spectral type of CoRoT targets, which is based
on broadband multi-colour photometry. We assess the accuracy of this
spectral classification for the first time. We find that the
classification method performs better for stars that were observed
during the mission-dedicated photometric ground-based campaigns.The
luminosity class is wrong for less than 7\% of the targets. Generally,
the effective temperature of stars classified as early type (O, B, and
A) is overestimated. Conversely, the temperature of stars classified as
later type tends to be underestimated. This is mainly due to the adverse
effect of interstellar reddening. We find that the median error on the
effective temperature is less than 5\% for dwarf stars classified with a
spectral later than F0, but it is worse for earlier type stars, with up
to 20$\backslash$\% error for A and late-B dwarfs, and up to 70\% for early-B and
O-type dwarfs. Similar results are found for giants, with a median error
that is lower than 7\% for G- and later type giants, but greater than 25\%
for earlier types. Overall, we find an average median absolute
temperature difference |Delta Teff| = 533+$\backslash$-6 K for the whole sample of
stars classified as dwarfs and |Delta Teff| = 280+$\backslash$-3 K for the whole
sample of giant stars. The corresponding standard deviation is of about
92+$\backslash$-5 K for dwarfs and 304+$\backslash$-4 K for giants. Typically for late-type
stars, this means that the classification is accurate to about half a
class.

$K\_s$-band luminosities of red clump stars, identified and characterized
by asteroseismology, to make independent distance estimates. Our results
suggest that Gaia TGAS distances contain a systematic error that
decreases with increasing distance. We propose a correction to mitigate
this offset as a function of parallax that is valid for the Kepler field
and values of parallax that are less than ${\sim} 1.6 \rm \, mas$. For
parallaxes greater than this we find agreement with previously published
values. We note that the TGAS distances to the red clump stars of the
open cluster M67 show a high level of disagreement that is difficult to

the information in the frequency power spectrum and apply these
techniques to Kepler data sets of different observing length to
represent the different space missions. We demonstrate that for KIC
12008916, a low-luminosity red giant branch star, we can extract useful
information from all data sets, and for all but the shortest data set we
obtain good constraint on the g-mode period spacing and core rotation
rates. We discuss how the high precision in these parameters will
constrain the stellar properties of stellar radius, distance, mass and
age. We show that high precision can be achieved in mass and hence age
when values of the g-mode period spacing are available. We caution that
tests to establish the accuracy of asteroseismic masses and ages are
still ``work in progress''.

  Abstract                 = {{Our GHOSTS survey measures the stellar envelope properties of 14 nearby
disk galaxies by imaging their resolved stellar populations with
HST/ACS{\amp}WFPC2. Most of the massive galaxies in the sample (Vrot
$\gt$200 km/s) have very extended stellar envelopes with Sersic law
profiles or mu(r)\~{}r\^{}-2.5 power law profiles in the outer regions. For
these massive galaxies we can fit the central bulge light and the outer
halo out to 30 kpc with one and the same Sersic profile and the stellar
surface density of the profiles correlate with Hubble type and bulge-
to-disk ratio. This suggests that the central bulges and inner halos are
created in the same process. Smaller galaxies (Vrot \~{}100 km/s) have much
smaller stellar envelopes, but depending on geometry, they could still
be more luminous than expected from satellite remnants in hierarchical
galaxy formation models. Alternatively, they could be created by disk
heating through the bombardment of small dark matter sub-halos. The
halos we fit are highly flattened, with minor- over-ma jor axis ratios
c/a=0.6. The halos are somewhat more compact than hierarchical model
predictions. The halos show small metallicity gradient out to 30 kpc and
the massive galaxies have typical [Fe/H]\~{}-0.8. We find indications of
halo substructure in many galaxies, but some halos seem remarkable
smooth.

  Abstract                 = {{Because the majority of massive stars are born as members of close
binary systems, populations of massive main-sequence stars contain
stellar mergers and products of binary mass transfer. We simulate
populations of massive stars accounting for all major binary evolution
effects based on the most recent binary parameter statistics and
extensively evaluate the effect of model uncertainties. Assuming
constant star formation, we find that 8\^{}$\{$+9$\}$\_$\{$-4$\}$\% of a sample of
early-type stars are the products of a merger resulting from a close
binary system. In total we find that 30\^{}$\{$+10$\}$\_$\{$-15$\}$\% of massive
main-sequence stars are the products of binary interaction. We show that
the commonly adopted approach to minimize the effects of binaries on an
observed sample by excluding systems detected as binaries through radial
velocity campaigns can be counterproductive. Systems with significant
radial velocity variations are mostly pre-interaction systems. Excluding
them substantially enhances the relative incidence of mergers and binary
products in the non-radial velocity variable sample. This poses a
challenge for testing single stellar evolutionary models. It also raises
the question of whether certain peculiar classes of stars, such as
magnetic O stars, are the result of binary interaction and it emphasizes
the need to further study the effect of binarity on the diagnostics that
are used to derive the fundamental properties (star-formation history,
initial mass function, mass-to-light ratio) of stellar populations
nearby and at high redshift.

  Abstract                 = {{Towards the end of their lives, stars like the Sun greatly expand to
become red giant stars. Such evolved stars could provide stringent tests
of stellar theory, as many uncertainties of the internal stellar
structure accumulate with age. Important examples are convective
overshooting and rotational mixing during the central hydrogen-burning
phase, which determine the mass of the helium core, but which are not
well understood. In principle, analysis of radial and non-radial stellar
oscillations can be used to constrain the mass of the helium core.
Although all giants are expected to oscillate, it has hitherto been
unclear whether non-radial modes are observable at all in red giants, or
whether the oscillation modes have a short or a long mode lifetime,
which determines the observational precision of the frequencies. Here we
report the presence of radial and non-radial oscillations in more than
300 giant stars. For at least some of the giants, the mode lifetimes are
of the order of a month. We observe giant stars with equally spaced
frequency peaks in the Fourier spectrum of the time series, as well as
giants for which the spectrum seems to be more complex. No satisfactory
theoretical explanation currently exists for our observations.

spectrograph design includes 4 wavelength channels, each with
VPH-gratings providing a nominal spectral resolving power of 28,000 and
a high-resolution mode of 50,000. The initial wavelength channels are
tailored for determining a large range of chemical elements suitable for
chemical tagging, but allow for grating upgrades reconfigurable between

stars, losing mass through a slow mechanical equatorial winds to produce
material rich in H-burning products. We propose that stars with high Na
and low O abundances (hereafter anomalous stars) are formed from matter
made of slow winds of individual massive stars and of interstellar
matter. The proportion of slow wind and of interstellar material is
fixed in order to reproduce the observed Li-Na anticorrelation in NGC
6752. <BR />Results: In the case that globular clusters, during their
lifetime, did not lose any stars, we found that to reproduce the
observed ratio of normal to anomalous stars, a flat initial mass
function (IMF) is needed, with typically a slope x=0.55 (a Salpeter's
IMF has x=1.35). In the case that globular clusters suffer from an
evaporation of normal stars, the IMF slope can be steeper: to have
x=1.35, about 96\% of the normal stars would be lost. We make predictions
for the distribution of stars as a function of their [O/Na] and obtain
quite reasonable agreement with that one observed for NGC 6752.
Predictions for the number fraction of stars with different values of
helium, of the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and
$^{16}$O/$^{17}$O ratios are discussed, as well as the
expected relations between values of [O/Na] and those of helium, of
[C/N], of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and of
$^{16}$O/$^{17}$O. Future observations might test these
predictions. We also provide predictions for the present day mass of the
clusters expressed in units of mass of the gas used to form stars, and
for the way the present day mass is distributed between the first and
second generation of stars and the stellar remnants.

explain the origin of the abundance anomalies observed in globular

stars with initial masses between 20 and 120 M\_{\sun} for an initial
metallicity Z = 0.0005 ([Fe/H]{\sime}-1.5). We discuss the
nucleosynthesis in the H-burning core of these objects and present the
chemical composition of their ejecta. We consider the impact of
uncertainties in the relevant nuclear reaction rates. <BR />Results:
Fast rotating stars reach critical velocity at the beginning of their
evolution and remain near the critical limit during the rest of the main
sequence and part of the He-burning phase. As a consequence they lose
large amounts of material through a mechanical wind which probably leads
to the formation of a slow outflowing disk. The material in this slow
wind is enriched in H-burning products and presents abundance patterns
similar to the chemical anomalies observed in globular cluster stars. In
particular, the C, N, O, Na and Li variations are well reproduced by our
model. However the rate of the $^{24}$Mg(p,{$\gamma$}) has to be
increased by a factor 1000 around 50 {\times} 10$^{6}$ K in order
to reproduce the amplitude of the observed Mg-Al anticorrelation. We
discuss how the long-lived low-mass stars currently observed in globular
clusters could have formed out of the slow wind material ejected by
massive stars.

T$_{e}$, which are in good agreement with those from radio

lower, by a factor of 2, than that previously obtained by Shaver et al.
No significant flattening of this relation is obtained out to 15kpc. At
the solar Galactocentric distance, 12+log(O/H)=8.48, in good agreement
with the O/H abundance measured in the local interstellar medium by
Meyer et al., and a factor of 2 lower than the solar abundance. Our
helium observations show that even a region ionized by a star earlier

generates large uncertainties on stellar ages. So far, several studies
have shown that convective cores must extend beyond the Schwarzschild
boundary. However, very few constraints exist on the size of this
extension and its dependency with stellar parameters. We used 3 years of
high-precision photometric data from the Kepler satellite to investigate
how stars whose mass lies around the limit for having a convective core
(M{\tilde}1.2 M\_{\sun}) can contribute to the longstanding question of the
size of convective cores. We constrained the amount of core overshooting
in 14 targets and found a tendency of overshooting to increase with
stellar mass in this mass range. These results will be presented in more
details in a paper in preparation.

giants has made it possible to probe the internal rotation profiles of
these stars, which brings new constraints on the transport of angular
momentum in stars. Mosser et al. (2012) have measured the rotation rates
in the central regions of intermediate-mass core helium burning stars
(secondary clump stars). Our aim was to exploit{\amp} the rotational
splittings of mixed modes to estimate the amount of radial differential
rotation in the interior of secondary clump stars using Kepler data, in
order to place constraints on angular momentum transport in
intermediate-mass stars. We selected a subsample of Kepler secondary
clump stars with mixed modes that are clearly rotationally split. By
applying a thorough statistical analysis, we showed that the splittings
of both gravity-dominated modes (trapped in central regions) and
p-dominated modes (trapped in the envelope) can be measured. We then
used these splittings to estimate the amount of differential rotation by
using inversion techniques and by applying a simplified approach based
on asymptotic theory (Goupil et al. 2013). We obtained evidence for a
weak radial differential rotation for six of the seven targets that were
selected, with the central regions rotating \$1.8$\backslash$pm0.3\$ to \$3.2$\backslash$pm1.0\$
times faster than the envelope. The last target was found to be
consistent with a solid-body rotation. This demonstrates that an
efficient redistribution of angular momentum occurs after the end of the
main sequence in the interior of intermediate-mass stars, either during
the short-lived subgiant phase, or once He-burning has started in the
core. In either case, this should bring constraints on the angular
momentum transport mechanisms that are at work.

disk to R0. The disk and bulge dominate vc(R) at R not greater than
about R0 only for Rd,*/R0 not greater than about 0.3. Since the only
knowledge we have of the halo derives from studies like the present one,
we allow it to contribute to the density at all radii. When allowed this
freedom, however, the halo causes changes in assumptions relating to R
much less than R0 to affect profoundly the structure of the best-fitting
model at R much greater than R0. For example, changing the disk slightly
from an exponential surface-density profile significantly changes the
form of vc(R) at R much greater than R0, where the disk makes a
negligible contribution to vc. Moreover, minor changes in the
constraints can cause the halo to develop a deep hole at its center that
is not physically plausible. These problems call into question the
proposition that flat rotation curves arise because galaxies have
physically distinct haloes rather than outward-increasing mass-to-light
ratios.

during the mission preparation, results from the mission and from
follow-up observations, and several mission-specific technical
parameters. The new photometric data constitute the subcatalog Exo-Cat,
and give consistent 4-color photometry of 14.0 million stars with a
completeness to 19th magnitude in the r-filter. It covers several zones
in the galactic plane around CoRoT pointings, with a total area of 209
deg$^{2}$. This Exo-Dat information system provides essential
technical support to the ongoing CoRoT light-curve analyses and
ground-based follow-up by supplying additional complementary information
such as the prior knowledge of the star's fundamental parameters or its
contamination level inside the large CoRoT photometric mask. The
database is fully interfaced with VO tools and thus benefits from
existing visualization and analysis tools like TOPCAT or ALADIN. It is
accessible to the CoRoT community through the Web, and will be gradually
opened to the public. It is the ideal tool to prepare the foreseen
statistical studies of the properties of the exoplanetary systems. As a
VO-compliant system, such analyses could thus benefit from the most
up-to-date classifier tools.

The CoRoT space mission, launched on 2006 December 27, has been
developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria,
Belgium, Brazil, ESA, Germany, and Spain. This project has made use of
various observations collected with the Isaac Newton Telescope at La
Palma and the GIRAFFE and UVES/FLAMES spectrographs at the VLT/UT2
Kueyen telescope (Paranal observatory, ESO, Chile: program 074.C-0633A,
081.C-0413).

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: We aim, on the one hand, to study the possible differences
of Li abundances between planet hosts and stars without detected planets
at effective temperatures hotter than the Sun, and on the other hand, to
explore the Li dip and the evolution of Li at high metallicities. <BR />
Methods: We present lithium abundances for 353 main sequence stars with
and without planets in the T$_{eff}$ range 5900-7200 K. We
observed 265 stars of our sample with HARPS spectrograph during
different planets search programs. We observed the remaining targets
with a variety of high-resolution spectrographs. The abundances are
derived by a standard local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis using
spectral synthesis with the code MOOG and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9
atmospheres. <BR /> Results: We find that hot jupiter host stars within
the T$_{eff}$ range 5900-6300 K show lower Li abundances, by 0.14
dex, than stars without detected planets. This offset has a significance
at the level 7{$\sigma$}, pointing to a stronger effect of planet formation
on Li abundances when the planets are more massive and migrate close to
the star. However, we also find that the average vsini of (a fraction
of) stars with hot jupiters is higher on average than for single stars
in the same T$_{eff}$ region, suggesting that rotational-induced
mixing (and not the presence of planets) might be the cause for a
greater depletion of Li. We confirm that the mass-metallicity dependence
of the Li dip is extended towards [Fe/H] \~{} 0.4 dex (beginning at [Fe/H]
\~{}-0.4 dex for our stars) and that probably reflects the mass-metallicity
correlation of stars of the same T$_{eff}$ on the main sequence.
We find that for the youngest stars ($\lt$1.5 Gyr) around the Li dip, the
depletion of Li increases with vsini values, as proposed by
rotationally-induced depletion models. This suggests that the Li dip
consists of fast rotators at young ages whereas the most Li-depleted old
stars show lower rotation rates (probably caused by the spin-down during
their long lifes). We have also explored the Li evolution with [Fe/H]
taking advantage of the metal-rich stars included in our sample. We find
that Li abundance reaches its maximum around solar metallicity, but
decreases in the most metal-rich stars, as predicted by some models of
Li Galactic production.

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: We want to study the effects of the formation of planets
and planetary systems on the atmospheric Li abundance of planet host

lithium abundances for 326 main sequence stars with and without planets
in the T$_{eff}$ range 5600-5900 K. The 277 stars come from the
HARPS sample, the remaining targets were observed with a variety of
high-resolution spectrographs. <BR /> Results: We confirm significant
differences in the Li distribution of solar twins (T$_{eff}$ =
T$_{&sun;}$ {\plusmn} 80 K, log g = log g$_{&sun;}$ {\plusmn}
0.2 and [Fe/H] = [Fe/H]$_{&sun;}$ {\plusmn} 0.2): the full sample
of planet host stars (22) shows Li average values lower than ``single''
stars with no detected planets (60). If we focus on subsamples with
narrower ranges in metallicity and age, we observe indications of a
similar result though it is not so clear for some of the subsamples.
Furthermore, we compare the observed spectra of several couples of stars
with very similar parameters that show differences in Li abundances up
to 1.6 dex. Therefore we show that neither age, mass, nor metallicity of
a parent star is the only cause for enhanced Li depletion in solar
analogues. <BR /> Conclusions: We conclude that another variable must
account for that difference and suggest that this could be the presence
of planets that causes additional rotationally induced mixing in the
external layers of planet host stars. Moreover, we find indications that
the amount of depletion of Li in planet-host solar-type stars is higher
when the planets are more massive than Jupiter.

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: To understand the formation and evolution of the different
stellar populations within our Galaxy it is essential to combine
detailed kinematical and chemical information for large samples of
stars. The aim of this work is to explore the chemical abundances of
neutron capture elements which are a product of different
nucleosynthesis processes taking place in diverse objects in the Galaxy,
such as massive stars, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and
supernovae (SNe) explosions. <BR /> Methods: We derive chemical
abundances of Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd, and Eu for a large sample
of more than 1000 FGK dwarf stars with high-resolution (R 115 000) and
high-quality spectra from the HARPS-GTO program. The abundances are
derived by a standard local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis
using measured equivalent widths (EWs) injected to the code MOOG and a
grid of Kurucz ATLAS9 atmospheres. <BR /> Results: We find that thick
disc stars are chemically disjunct for Zn and Eu and also show on
average higher Zr but lower Ba and Y than the thin disc stars. We also
discovered that the previously identified high-{$\alpha$} metal-rich
population is also enhanced in Cu, Zn, Nd, and Eu with respect to the
thin disc but presents lower Ba and Y abundances on average, following
the trend of thick disc stars towards higher metallities and further
supporting the different chemical composition of this population. By
making a qualitative comparison of O (pure {$\alpha$}), Mg, Eu (pure
r-process), and s-process elements we can distinguish between the
contribution of the more massive stars (SNe II for {$\alpha$} and r-process
elements) and the lower mass stars (AGBs) whose contribution to the
enrichment of the Galaxy is delayed, due to their longer lifetimes. The
ratio of heavy-s to light-s elements of thin disc stars presents the
expected behaviour (increasing towards lower metallicities) and can be
explained by a major contribution of low-mass AGB stars for s-process
production at disc metallicities. However, the opposite trend found for
thick disc stars suggests that intermediate-mass AGB stars play an
important role in the enrichment of the gas from where these stars
formed. Previous works in the literature also point to a possible
primary production of light-s elements at low metallicities to explain
this trend. Finally, we also find an enhancement of light-s elements in
the thin disc at super-solar metallicities which could be caused by the
contribution of metal-rich AGB stars. <BR /> Conclusions: This work
proves the utility of homogeneous and high-quality data of modest sample
sizes. We find some interesting trends that might help to differentiate
thin and thick disc population (such as [Zn/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] ratios) and
that can also provide useful constraints for Galactic chemical evolution
models of the different populations in the Galaxy.

[Mg/Fe] = 0.38 {\plusmn} 0.06 for NGC 6426 from spectroscopy for the
first time. <BR /> Conclusions: The method proved to be reliable for red
giant stars observed with resolution R \~{} 2000, yielding results
compatible with high-resolution spectroscopy. The derived
{$\alpha$}-element abundances show [{$\alpha$}/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] consistent with
that of field stars at the same metallicities.

  Abstract                 = {{Due to their volatile nature, when sulfur and zinc are observed in
external galaxies, their determined abundances represent the gas-phase
abundances in the interstellar medium. This implies that they can be
used as tracers of the chemical enrichment of matter in the Universe at
high redshift. Comparable observations in stars are more difficult and,
until recently, plagued by small number statistics. We wish to exploit
the Gaia ESO Survey (GES) data to study the behaviour of sulfur and zinc
abundances of a large number of Galactic stars, in a homogeneous way. By
using the UVES spectra of the GES sample, we are able to assemble a
sample of 1301 Galactic stars, including stars in open and globular
clusters in which both sulfur and zinc were measured. We confirm the
results from the literature that sulfur behaves as an alpha-element. We
find a large scatter in [Zn/Fe] ratios among giant stars around solar
metallicity. The lower ratios are observed in giant stars at
Galactocentric distances less than 7.5 kpc. No such effect is observed
among dwarf stars, since they do not extend to that radius. Given the
sample selection, giants and dwarfs are observed at different Galactic
locations, and it is plausible, and compatible with simple calculations,
that Zn-poor giants trace a younger population more polluted by SN Ia
yields. It is necessary to extend observations in order to observe both
giants and dwarfs at the same Galactic location. Further theoretical
work on the evolution of zinc is also necessary.

low-mass galaxies (M$_{star}$ = 2 {\times} 10$^{6}$ - 5
{\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{&sun;}$) using the Feedback in
Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. While previous studies
emphasized the impact of feedback on dark matter profiles, we
investigate the impact on the stellar component: kinematics, radial
migration, size evolution, and population gradients. Feedback-driven
outflows/inflows drive significant radial stellar migration over both
short and long timescales via two processes: (1) outflowing/infalling
gas can remain star-forming, producing young stars that migrate {\tilde}1
kpc within their first 100 Myr, and (2) gas outflows/inflows drive
strong fluctuations in the global potential, transferring energy to all
stars. These processes produce several dramatic effects. First,
galaxies{\rsquo} effective radii can fluctuate by factors of $\gt$2 over
{\tilde}200 Myr, and these rapid size fluctuations can account for much of
the observed scatter in the radius at fixed M$_{star}$. Second,
the cumulative effects of many outflow/infall episodes steadily heat
stellar orbits, causing old stars to migrate outward most strongly. This
age-dependent radial migration mixes{\mdash}and even
inverts{\mdash}intrinsic age and metallicity gradients. Thus, the
galactic-archaeology approach of calculating radial star formation
histories from stellar populations at z = 0 can be severely biased.
These effects are strongest at M$_{star}$ {\ap}
10$^{7-9.6}$ M$_{&sun;}$, the same regime where
feedback most efficiently cores galaxies. Thus, detailed measurements of
stellar kinematics in low-mass galaxies can strongly constrain feedback
models and test baryonic solutions to small-scale problems in
{$\Lambda$}CDM.

process, and was undertaken by the NDAC and FAST Consortia, together
responsible for the production of the Hipparcos Catalogue, and the Tycho
Consortium, responsible for the production of the Tycho Catalogue. A
fourth scientific consortium, the INCA Consortium, was responsible for
the construction of the Hipparcos observing programme, compiling the
best-available data for the selected stars before launch into the
Hipparcos Input Catalogue. The production of the Hipparcos and Tycho
Catalogues marks the formal end of the involvement in the mission by the
European Space Agency and the four scientific consortia.

For more complete and detailed information on the data, the user is
advised to refer to Volume 1 (''Introduction and Guide to the Data'', ESA
SP-1200) of the printed Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogues. The user should
also note that in order to convert the Double and Multiple Systems
(Component solutions) data file hip$_{dm}$c.dat into FITS format
it is first necessary to filter the file according to whether the entry
is a component record (identified by COMP in field DCM5) or a
correlation record (identified by CORR in field DCM5) because of the
different structures of the respective records. On a Unix system this
can be achieved as follows:

grep COMP hip$_{dm}$c.dat {\gt} h$_{dm}$com.dat grep CORR
hip$_{dm}$c.dat {\gt} h$_{dm}$cor.dat

The catalogue description file (this file) gives the relevant
information for converting the main data files, including
h$_{dm}$cor.dat and h$_{dm}$com.dat, into FITS format.

The machine readable data files (i.e. those available on CD-ROM and the
subset available from the CDS) contain several extra fields in addition
to the data from the printed catalogue. These fields are identified by
the letter `M' in the data label (e.g. the field DGM1 contains data only
available in the machine readable file hip$_{dm}$g.dat).

(19 data files).

observations of atomic hydrogen but stars associated with flaring have
not hitherto been reported. In the area beyond the Galactic centre the
stars are largely hidden from view by dust, and the kinematic distances
of the gas cannot be estimated. Thirty-two possible Cepheid stars (young
pulsating variable stars) in the direction of the Galactic bulge were
recently identified. With their well-calibrated period-luminosity
relationships, Cepheid stars are useful distance indicators. When
observations of these stars are made in two colours, so that their
distance and reddening can be determined simultaneously, the problems of
dust obscuration are minimized. Here we report that five of the
candidates are classical Cepheid stars. These five stars are distributed
from approximately one to two kiloparsecs above and below the plane of
the Galaxy, at radial distances of about 13 to 22 kiloparsecs from the
centre. The presence of these relatively young (less than 130 million
years old) stars so far from the Galactic plane is puzzling, unless they
are in the flared outer disk. If so, they may be associated with the
outer molecular arm.

shown a tight correlation between various elemental abundances and age,
in particular [Y/Mg]. If this relation is real and valid for other types
of stars as well as elsewhere in the Galaxy, it would provide a very
powerful tool to derive ages of stars without the need to resort to
determining their masses (evolutionary stage) very precisely. The method
would also likely work if the stellar parameters have relatively large
errors. The studies presented in the recent literature span a narrow
range of [Fe/H]. By studying a larger sample of solar neighbourhood
dwarfs with a much larger range of [Fe/H], we find that the relation
between [Y/Mg] and age depends on the [Fe/H] of the stars. Hence, it
appears that the [Y/Mg]-age relation is unique to solar analogues.

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: We present the results of an analysis of 107 extremely
metal-poor (EMP) stars with metallicities lower than [Fe/H] =- 3.0,
identified in medium-resolution spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). Our analysis provides estimates of the stellar effective
temperatures and surface gravities, as well as iron, calcium, and
magnesium abundances. <BR /> Methods: We followed the same method as in
previous papers of this series. The method is based on comparisons of
the observed spectra with synthetic spectra. The abundances of Fe, Ca,
and Mg were determined by fitting spectral regions that are dominated by
lines of each element. In addition, we present a technique to determine
upper limits for elements whose features are not detected in a given
spectrum. We also analyzed our sample with the SEGUE stellar parameter
pipeline to obtain additional determinations of the atmospheric
parameters and iron and alpha-element abundances, which we thend compare
with ours. In addition, we used these parameters to infer [C/Fe] ratios.
<BR /> Results: Ca is typically the only element in these spectra with a
moderate to low signal-to-noise ratio and medium resolution in this
metallicity regime with lines that are sufficiently strong to reliably
measure its abundance. Fe and Mg exhibit weaker features that in most
cases only provide upper limits. We measured [Ca/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] for EMP
stars in the SDSS spectra and conclude that most of the stars exhibit
the typical enhancement level for {$\alpha$}-elements, \~{}+0.4, although some
stars for which only [Fe/H] upper limits could be estimated indicate
higher [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios. We also find that 26\% of the stars in our
sample can be classified as carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars and
that the frequency of CEMP stars also increases with decreasing
metallicity, as has been reported for previous samples. We identify a
rare, bright (g = 11.90) EMP star, SDSS J134144.61+474128.6, with [Fe/H]
=- 3.27, [C/Fe] = + 0.95, and elevated magnesium ([Mg/Fe] =+ 0.62), an
abundance pattern typical of CEMP-no stars.

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: We analyze a sample of 3944 low-resolution (R \~{} 2000)
optical spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), focusing on
stars with effective temperatures 5800 {\le} T$_{eff}$ {\le} 6300 K,
and distances from the Milky Way plane in excess of 5 kpc, and determine
their abundances of Fe, Ca, and Mg. <BR /> Methods: We followed the same
methodology as in the previous paper in this series, deriving
atmospheric parameters by {$\chi$}$^{2}$ minimization, but this time
we obtained the abundances of individual elements by fitting their
associated spectral lines. Distances were calculated from absolute
magnitudes obtained by a statistical comparison of our stellar
parameters with stellar-evolution models. <BR /> Results: The
observations reveal a decrease in the abundances of iron, calcium, and
magnesium at large distances from the Galactic center. The median
abundances for the halo stars analyzed are fairly constant up to a
Galactocentric distance r \~{} 20 kpc, rapidly decrease between r \~{} 20 and
r \~{} 40 kpc, and flatten out to significantly lower values at larger
distances, consistent with previous studies. In addition, we examine
[Ca/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H] and Galactocentric distance.
Our results show that the most distant parts of the halo show a steeper
variation of [Ca/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] with iron. We found that at the range
-1.6 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.4, [Ca/Fe] decreases with distance, in
agreement with earlier results based on local stars. However, the
opposite trend is apparent for [Mg/Fe]. Our conclusion that the outer
regions of the halo are more metal-poor than the inner regions, based on
in situ observations of distant stars, agrees with recent results based
on inferences from the kinematics of more local stars, and with
predictions of recent galaxy formation simulations for galaxies similar
to the Milky Way.

can be constrained from the analysis of stars in the Milky Way's halo
system. We examine the variation of chemical abundances in distant halo
stars observed by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution
Experiment (APOGEE), as a function of distance from the Galactic Centre
(r) and iron abundance ([M/H]), in the range 5 {\lsim} r {\lsim} 30 kpc
and -2.5 $\lt$ [M/H] $\lt$ 0.0. We perform a statistical analysis of the
abundance ratios derived by the APOGEE pipeline (ASPCAP) and distances
calculated by several approaches. Our analysis reveals signatures of a
different chemical enrichment between the inner and outer regions of the
halo, with a transition at about 15 kpc. The derived metallicity
distribution function exhibits two peaks, at [M/H] {\tilde} -1.5 and
{\tilde}-2.1, consistent with previously reported halo metallicity
distributions. We obtain a difference of {\tilde}0.1 dex for
{$\alpha$}-element-to-iron ratios for stars at r $\gt$ 15 kpc and [M/H] $\gt$
-1.1 (larger in the case of O, Mg, and S) with respect to the nearest
halo stars. This result confirms previous claims for low-{$\alpha$} stars
found at larger distances. Chemical differences in elements with other
nucleosynthetic origins (Ni, K, Na, and Al) are also detected. C and N
do not provide reliable information about the interstellar medium from
which stars formed because our sample comprises red giant branch and
asymptotic giant branch stars and can experience mixing of material to
their surfaces.

located at RG $\gt$11 kpc and present the radial distribution of
abundances towards the Galaxy anticentre. We carried out optical
spectroscopic observations of nine HII regions with the WHT. The sample
was increased by searching the literature for optical observations of
regions towards the Galactic anticentre, re-analysing them to obtain a
single sample of 23 objects covering the Galactocentric radius from 11
kpc to 18 kpc to be processed in a homogeneous and consistent manner.
Accurate electron densities and temperatures of several ionic species
were derived in 13 HII regions. These physical parameters were applied
to the spectra to determine direct total chemical abundances. For those
regions without direct estimations of temperature, chemical abundances
were derived by performing tailor-made photoionisation models and/or by
using an empirical relation obtained from radio recombination and
optical temperatures. We performed weighted least-squares fits to the
distribution of the derived abundances along the Galactocentric
distances to study the radial gradients of metallicity. The
distributions O/H, N/H, S/H, and Ar/H towards the anticentre can be
represented by decreasing linear radial gradients, while in the case of
N/O abundances the radial distribution is better fitted with a two-zone
model. The He/H radial gradient is presented here for the first time; we
find a slope that is not significantly different from zero. The derived
gradient for oxygen shows a clear decrease with distance with a slope of
-0.053dex/kpc. Although a shallower slope at large Galactocentric
distances is suggested by our data, the flattening of the distribution
cannot be confirmed and more objects towards the anticentre need to be
studied in order to establish the true form of the metallicity gradient.

bar particles trapped into the bar are identified through the orbital
Jacobi energy $E\_{J}$, which allows us to identify the building blocks
of the B/P feature and investigate their kinematic properties. Finally,
we present preliminary results showing that the high-V$\_{\rm los}$
features observed towards the Milky Way bulge are a natural consequence
of a large-scale $\backslash$textit$\{$midplane$\}$ particle structure, which is unlikely
associated with the Galactic bar.

Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment spectroscopic survey, of
a metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -1.3 dex) field giant star with an extreme
Mg-Al abundance ratio ([Mg/Fe] = -0.31 dex; [Al/Fe] = 1.49
dex). Such low Mg/Al ratios are seen only among the second-generation
population of globular clusters (GCs) and are not present among Galactic
disk field stars. The light-element abundances of this star,
2M16011638-1201525, suggest that it could have been born in a GC. We
explore several origin scenarios, studying the orbit of the star in
particular to check the probability of its being kinematically related
to known GCs. We performed simple orbital integrations assuming the
estimated distance of 2M16011638-1201525 and the available
six-dimensional phase-space coordinates of 63 GCs, looking for close
encounters in the past with a minimum distance approach within the tidal
radius of each cluster. We found a very low probability that
2M16011638-1201525 was ejected from most GCs; however, we note that the
best progenitor candidate to host this star is GC {$\omega$} Centauri (NGC
5139). Our dynamical investigation demonstrates that 2M16011638-1201525
reaches a distance | $\{$Z$\}$$_{\max }$| $\backslash$lt 3 $\{$kpc$\}$ from the Galactic
plane and minimum and maximum approaches to the Galactic center of R
$_{min}$ $\lt$ 0.62 kpc and R $_{max}$ $\lt$ 7.26 kpc in an
eccentric (e {\tilde} 0.53) and retrograde orbit. Since the extreme
chemical anomaly of 2M16011638-1201525 has also been observed in halo
field stars, this object could also be considered a halo contaminant,
likely to have been ejected into the Milky Way disk from the halo. We
conclude that 2M16011638-20152 is also kinematically consistent with the
disk but chemically consistent with halo field stars.

Galactic longitude 240{\deg}$\lt$l$\lt$ 360{\deg} and V$_{LSR}$$\lt$
-239 km s$^{-1}$, we computed orbits for 329 RAVE stars that were
originally selected as chemically and kinematically related to {$\omega$}
Centauri. The orbits were integrated in a Milky-Way-like axisymmetric
Galactic potential, ignoring the effects of the dynamical evolution of
{$\omega$} Centauri due to the tidal effects of the Galaxy disk on the
cluster along time. We also ignored secular changes in the Milky Way
potential over time. In a Monte Carlo scheme, and under the assumption
that the stars may have been ejected with velocities greater than the
escape velocity (V$_{rel}$$\gt$V$_{esc,0}$) from the cluster,
we identified 15 stars as having close encounters with {$\omega$} Centauri:
(i) 8 stars with relative velocities V$_{rel}$$\lt$ 200 km
s$^{-1}$ may have been ejected \~{}200 Myr ago from {$\omega$} Centauri;
(ii) another group of 7 stars were identified with high relative
velocity V$_{rel}$$\gt$ 200 km s$^{-1}$ during close
encounters, and it seems unlikely that they were ejected from {$\omega$}
Centauri. We also confirm the link between J131340.4-484714 as a
potential member of {$\omega$} Centauri, and probably ejected \~{}2.0 Myr ago,
with a relative velocity V$_{rel}$ \~{} 80 km s$^{-1}$.

around the globular cluster {$\omega$} Centauri, aimed at detecting debris
material from the alleged progenitor galaxy of the cluster. We detected
48 RR Lyrae stars, only 11 of which have been previously reported. Ten
of the eleven previously known stars were found inside the tidal radius
of the cluster. The rest were located outside the tidal radius up to
distances of \~{}6 degrees from the center of the cluster. Several of these
stars are located at distances similar to that of {$\omega$} Centauri. We
investigate the probability that they may have been stripped off the
cluster. To do this, we studied their properties (mean periods) by
calculating the expected halo and thick-disk population of RR Lyrae
stars in this part of the sky, analyzing the radial velocity of a
sub-sample of the RR Lyrae stars, and finally, studying the probable
orbits of this sub-sample around the Galaxy. The results of these
investigations do not support the scenario that there is significant
tidal debris around {$\omega$} Centauri, which confirms previous studies on
the region. It is puzzling that tidal debris has been found elsewhere
but not near the cluster itself.

  Abstract                 = {{We report the peculiar chemical abundance patterns of eleven atypical
Milky Way (MW) field red giant stars observed by the Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). These atypical
giants exhibit strong Al and N enhancements accompanied by C and Mg
depletions, strikingly similar to those observed in the so-called
second-generation (SG) stars of globular clusters (GCs). Remarkably, we
find low-Mg abundances ([Mg/Fe]$\lt$0.0) together with strong Al and N
overabundances in the majority (5/7) of the metal-rich ([Fe/H]$\gtrsim -
1.0$) sample stars, which is at odds with actual observations of SG
stars in Galactic CGs of similar metallicities. This chemical pattern is
unique and unprecedented among MW stars, posing urgent questions about
its origin. These atypical stars could be former SG stars of dissolved
GCs formed with intrinsically lower abundances of Mg and enriched Al
(subsequently self-polluted by massive AGB stars) or the result of
exotic binary systems. We speculate that the stars Mg-deficiency as well
as the orbital properties suggest that they could have an extragalactic
origin. This discovery should guide future dedicated spectroscopic
searches of atypical stellar chemical patterns in our Galaxy; a
fundamental step forward to understand the Galactic formation and
evolution.

  Abstract                 = {{For 6 years the Convection, Rotation, and Planetary Transits (CoRoT)
space mission has acquired photometric data from more than one hundred
thousand point sources towards and directly opposite from the inner and
outer regions of the Galaxy. The high temporal resolution of the CoRoT
data combined with the wide time span of the observations has enabled
the study of short and long time variations in unprecedented detail.
From the initial sample of 2534 stars classified as M-giants in the
CoRoT databasis, we selected 1428 targets that exhibit well defined
variability, using visual inspection. The variability period and
amplitude of C1 stars (stars having Teff {\lt} 4200 K) were computed
using Lomb-Scargle and harmonic fit methods. The trends found in the V-I
vs J-K color-color diagram are in agreement with standard empirical
calibrations for M-giants. The sources located towards the inner regions
of the Galaxy are distributed throughout the diagram while the majority
of the stars towards the outer regions of the Galaxy are spread between
the calibrations of M-giants and the predicted position for Carbon
stars. The stars classified as supergiants follow a different sequence
from the one found for giant stars. We also performed a KS test of the
period and amplitude of stars towards the inner and outer regions of the
Galaxy. We obtained a low probability that the two samples come from the
same parent distribution. The observed behavior of the period-amplitude
and period-Teff diagrams are, in general, in agreement with those found
for Kepler sources and ground based photometry, with pulsation being the
dominant cause responsible for the observed modulation. We also conclude
that short-time variations on M-Giant stars do not exist orare very rare
and the few cases we found are possibly related to biases or background
stars.

coworkers, developed for the solar neighborhood, to other regions of the
disk of the Galaxy in order to reproduce the observed element abundance
gradients. The model describes the Galaxy as a two-zone system (halo and
disk) sliced into nine cylindrical concentric regions and studies the
time evolution of the five populations which inhabit the Milky Way:
diffuse gas, molecular clouds, low-mass (m less than 4 M solar masses)
and high-mass stars, and stellar remnants. Our final aim is to reproduce
the metallicity gradients that are observed in the Milky Way and in
other external galaxies. We analyze the evolution of these gradients in
time in order to relate their behavior to other galactic quantities such
as the star formation rate and the infall rate. The model describes the
Galaxy by fitting a large number of observational constraints: abundance
gradients, age-metallicity relations for disk and halo, both gas and
mass distributions (including radial differences in the characteristic
shapes of atomic and molecular gas), and radial distribution and history
of star formation rate. The time evolution of abundance gradients is
computed, revealing a flattening of gradients with time. In particular,
the oxygen abundance was steeper at early times as a consequence of a
larger infall. Since the disk is evolving and the gas is consumed, a
saturation level is reached in every ring and the gradient will decrease
to a minimum value.

Survey-III/Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment
(APOGEE) spectrograph, for which we estimate stellar ages and the local
star formation history (SFH). The high-resolution (R {\tilde} 22,500), near
infrared (1.51-1.7 {$\mu$}m) APOGEE spectra provide measurements of
stellar atmospheric parameters (temperature, surface gravity, [M/H], and
[{$\alpha$}/M]). Due to the smaller uncertainties in surface gravity
possible with high-resolution spectra and accurate Hipparcos distance
measurements, we are able to calculate the stellar masses to within 30\%.
For giants, the relatively rapid evolution up the red giant branch
allows the age to be constrained by the mass. We examine methods of
estimating age using both the mass-age relation directly and a
Bayesian isochrone matching of measured parameters, assuming a constant
SFH. To improve the SFH prior, we use a hierarchical modeling approach
to constrain the parameters of the model SFH using the age probability
distribution functions of the data. The results of an {$\alpha$}-dependent
Gaussian SFH model show a clear age-[{$\alpha$}/M] relation at all
ages. Using this SFH model as the prior for an empirical Bayesian
analysis, we determine ages for individual stars. The resulting
age-metallicity relation is flat, with a slight decrease in [M/H]
at the oldest ages and a {\tilde}0.5 dex spread in metallicity across most
ages. For stars with ages {\lsim}1 Gyr we find a smaller spread,
consistent with radial migration having a smaller effect on these young
stars than on the older stars.

planetary systems like our own Solar System? In this dissertation, I
approach this question from several different angles and make inferences
about the frequency and distribution of planets based on the large,
publicly-available datasets from the Kepler Mission. I develop two
powerful and practical methods for mining for planetary transit signals
in the hundreds of thousands of stellar light curves measured by Kepler.
The first method is designed to find planets using the data from the K2
phase of the Mission where systematics introduced by the instrument
dominate the measurements. Applying this method to the first publicly
available dataset from K2, Campaign 1, I published more than thirty new
exoplanet candidates. The second transit search technique is designed to
find transits of planets with orbital periods longer than the four year
baseline of the Kepler Mission. These are interesting planets because
they are expected to have the largest dynamical influence on the
formation and evolution of their planetary systems but, to date, no
systematic search for these signals has been published. I demonstrate
that this method is robust and tractable and make predictions for the
planet yields in the Kepler dataset. I derive a general framework for
making justified probabilistic inferences about the population of
planets based on noisy and incomplete catalogs of exoplanet
measurements. Applying this to a previously published catalog of
exoplanets orbiting stars like our Sun, I measure the joint
period-radius distribution of these planets taking into account survey
selection effects and the large measurement uncertainties. Despite the
fact that this catalog includes no true Earth analogs, I use the
detected systems and weak smoothness assumptions about the underlying
distribution to make a probabilistic estimate of the frequency of
Earth-like planets.

algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters
compared to sim N(2) for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional

found around Sun-like stars that are either Earth-sized but on shorter
periods, or else on year-long orbits but somewhat larger. Under strong
assumptions, exoplanet catalogs have been used to make an extrapolated
estimate of the rate at which Sun-like stars host Earth analogs. These
studies are complicated by the fact that every catalog is censored by
non-trivial selection effects and detection efficiencies, and every
property (period, radius, etc.) is measured noisily. Here we present a
general hierarchical probabilistic framework for making justified
inferences about the population of exoplanets, taking into account
survey completeness and, for the first time, observational
uncertainties. We are able to make fewer assumptions about the
distribution than previous studies; we only require that the occurrence
rate density be a smooth function of period and radius (employing a
Gaussian process). By applying our method to synthetic catalogs, we
demonstrate that it produces more accurate estimates of the whole
population than standard procedures based on weighting by inverse
detection efficiency. We apply the method to an existing catalog of
small planet candidates around G dwarf stars. We confirm a previous
result that the radius distribution changes slope near Earth's radius.
We find that the rate density of Earth analogs is about 0.02 (per star
per natural logarithmic bin in period and radius) with large
uncertainty. This number is much smaller than previous estimates made
with the same data but stronger assumptions.

primary goal of this survey is to constrain the formation processes of
the bulge and establish whether it is predominantly a merger or
instability remnant. From the spectra (R = 11 000), we have measured
radial velocities and determined stellar parameters, including
metallicities and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios. Distances were estimated from the
derived stellar parameters and about 14 000 stars are red giants within
3.5 kpc of the Galactic Centre. In this paper, we present the
observations and analysis methods. Subsequent papers (III and IV) will
discuss the stellar metallicity distribution and kinematics of the
Galactic bulge and inner disc, and the implications for the formation of
the bulge.

Be 39, M 67, NGC 188, and NGC 1193, respectively. The two stars observed
in the field of Be 31 have disparate radial velocities and elemental
abundance patterns, and also disagree with the possible Be 31 star
studied by Yong et al. We conclude that membership has yet to be
established for this important cluster, and therefore no element
abundances measured here or in previous studies of Be 31 should be taken
as definitive cluster abundances. A careful comparison of our results
for the clusters M 67 and Be 32 to those of other studies shows general
good agreement and identifies systematic differences resulting from
different analyses. After combination of our results with those of other
studies for clusters spanning the full R $_{gc}$ range of the thin
disk, we explore the abundance distributions as a function of R
$_{gc}$ and age for the elements Fe, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti,
and Ni. As found in previous work, the [Fe/H] gradient appears to be
continuous up to R $_{gc}$ \~{} 13 kpc before flattening in the outer
disk. [X/Fe] ratios show a scatter of 0.2-0.3 dex at all R
$_{gc}$, for all elements considered. The [X/Fe] values of the six
clusters analyzed here are consistent with those of other clusters of
similar metallicity and Galactocentric location. Our whole cluster
sample shows trends of increasing [O/Fe] and [Al/Fe] with age, although
these trends vanish with the inclusion of other clusters from the
literature. Larger, homogeneous open cluster samples are necessary to
verify the existence and magnitude of abundance trends with age.

new moderate-resolution spectroscopic data obtained with multiobject
spectrographs on the Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Cerro Tololo
Inter-American Observatory 4 m telescopes are used to determine radial
velocities and mean cluster metallicities. These new results are
combined with data published previously by Friel {\amp} Janes to provide
a sample of 459 giants in 39 old open clusters, which are used to
investigate radial abundance gradients in the Galactic disk. Based on an
updated abundance calibration of spectroscopic indices measuring Fe and
Fe-peak element blends, this larger sample yields an abundance gradient
of -0.06+/-0.01 dex kpc$^{-1}$ over a range in Galactocentric
radius of 7 to 16 kpc. There is a slight suggestion of a steepening of
the abundance gradient with increasing cluster age in this sample, but
the significance of the result is limited by the restricted distance
range for the youngest clusters. The clusters show no correlation of
metallicity with age in the solar neighborhood. Consistent with the
evidence for a steepening of the gradient with age, the clusters in the
outer disk beyond 10 kpc show a suggestion at the 1.5 {$\sigma$} level of a

  Abstract                 = {{Based on a simple model of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way disk,
we investigate the disk oxygen abundance gradient and its time
evolution. Two star formation rates (SFRs) are considered, one is the
classical Kennicutt-Schmidt law ({$\Psi$} = 0.25{$\Sigma$}$^{1.4}$
$_{gas}$, hereafter C-KS law), another is the modified Kennicutt
law ({\upsi} = {$\alpha$}{$\Sigma$}$^{1.4}$ $_{gas}$(V/r),
hereafter M-KS law). In both cases, the model can produce some amount of
abundance gradient, and the gradient is steeper in the early epoch of
disk evolution. However, we find that when C-KS law is adopted, the
classical chemical evolution model, which assumes a radially dependent
infall timescale, cannot produce a sufficiently steep present-day
abundance gradient. This problem disappears if we introduce a disk
formation timescale, which means that at early times, infalling gas
cools down onto the inner disk only, while the outer disk forms later.
This kind of model, however, will predict a very steep gradient in the
past. When the M-KS law is adopted, the model can properly predict both
the current abundance gradient and its time evolution, matching recent
observations from planetary nebulae and open clusters along the Milky
Way disk. Our best model also predicts that outer disk (artificially
defined as the disk with R$_{g}$ $\gt$= 8 kpc) has a steeper
gradient than the inner disk. The observed outer disk gradients from
Cepheids, open clusters, and young stars show quite controversial
results. There are also some hints from Cepheids that the outer disk
abundance gradient may have a bimodal distribution. More data is needed
in order to clarify the outer disk gradient problem. Our model
calculations show that for an individual Milky Way-type galaxy, a better
description of the local star formation is the M-KS law.

  Abstract                 = {{This fifth in a series of papers finishes the model atmosphere analyses
of an unbiased, volume-complete sample of more than 300 nearby
solar-type stars. The sample first disintegrates into thick-disc and
thin-disc stars on account of their different distributions in the
[Mg/H]-[Fe/Mg] chemical abundance plane. Detailed stellar age-datings of
the locally few, but very relevant, subgiants show this map to be the
sequel of a major star formation gap and hence the legacy for the two
stellar populations. Among the stars of the thin disc the subgiant 70
Vir with {$\tau$}= 8.1 {\plusmn} 0.6 Gyr remains the best case to constrain
the age of this comparatively young population. Uncertainties for the
existing thick-disc subgiants are about twice as much, but they
consistently promote ages of 12-13 Gyr. The unbiased thin-disc
metallicity distribution functions of magnesium and iron average at
{\lt}[Mg/H]{\gt}=-0.009 {\plusmn} 0.012 dex and {\lt}[Fe/H]{\gt}=-0.034
{\plusmn} 0.015 dex, thereby demonstrating that the Sun is a typical
thin-disc star in terms of these two elements. The small but likewise
unbiased sample of thick-disc stars leads to {\lt}[Mg/H]{\gt}=-0.207
{\plusmn} 0.049 dex and {\lt}[Fe/H]{\gt}=-0.584 {\plusmn} 0.057 dex, which
implies that about two-thirds of the {$\alpha$}-element magnesium was
already synthesized in the early Milky Way. Similarly, the
age-metallicity relations for the thin disc result in
{$\Delta$}[Mg/H]=+0.006 dex Gyr$^{-1}$ and {$\Delta$}[Fe/H]=+0.017 dex
Gyr$^{-1}$ and lead to the conclusion that a similar percentage of
iron was synthesized before the birth of the thin disc. In comparison
with the considerable metallicity dispersions {$\sigma$}$_{[Mg/H]}$=
0.151 dex and {$\sigma$}$_{[Fe/H]}$= 0.191 dex for the stars of the
thin disc, this immediately explains the coexistence of old, metal rich
as well as young, fairly metal poor stars within this stellar
population. The stellar multiplicities of the solar-type thin-disc stars
show a minority of less than 47 per cent to be single and at least 15
per cent to belong to triple and higher level systems. More concisely,
in terms of the primary masses there is a clear correlation with mass
with a cross-over of preferentially single to binary stars at M{\sime}
1.25 M$_{&sun;}$ and a fraction of 21 per cent of triple and
higher level systems at this particular mass. The steady record of new
discoveries of nearby companion stars renders these numbers, however, as
yet provisional, with an ever-decreasing fraction of single objects. For
the thick disc the multiplicity statistics are necessarily weak, yet
tentatively imply even less single stars and eventually more triple or
higher level systems. Most importantly, and as already addressed in the
previous papers of this series, the rigorous census of the long-lived
stars of the sample uncovers the thick disc as a massive, dark
population with a 20 per cent local normalization, and, on account of
its larger scaleheight, a mass comparable to that of the thin disc. With
the ages of its stars at or above 12 Gyr the thick-disc epoch then leads
to a very different star formation rate and qualifies this stellar
population as a single-burst component, much at variance with the thin
disc whose stars cover the complete stellar age range of 1 Myr up to 8
Gyr. Such information conveyed by the stars of the solar neighbourhood
then clearly do not support a gradual build-up scenario, a hierarchical
cold-dark-matter-dominated formation picture for our parent spiral.
Provided the Milky Way is not an unusual spiral galaxy, it implies that
this paradigm is also challenged in a much broader context.

{\plusmn} 0.08 dex. In line with its young age and its kinematics, this
consistently associates Capella with the Hyades moving group. The
measured projected rotational velocities, vsin i $_{Aa}$ = 3.5
{\plusmn} 0.8 km s$^{-1}$ and vsin i $_{Ab}$ = 35.4 {\plusmn}
3.2 km s$^{-1}$, both agree with rotational and orbital
coplanarity and synchronous orbital rotation for the Aa component. At an
orbital period P = 104 d the primary's bound rotation together with the
almost zero orbital eccentricity are both key characteristics of this
binary and clearly imply that the Aa component must have passed the tip
of the giant branch. Whether in that phase Capella also became a mass
transfer system remains inconclusive at present, though the high
rotational velocity of the less evolved Hertzsprung gap secondary and
the very diverse lithium abundances of both its components render this a
plausible case.

G-type stars are presented. The sample is confined to the main-sequence,
turnoff and subgiant region, regardless of the metal abundance. On the
base of these data, spectroscopic parallaxes are calculated and compared
to the Hipparcos astrometry to explore the reliability of the derived
stellar parameters, notably the surface gravity and metal abundance
scale. The spectroscopic distance scale is found in good agreement with
the Hipparcos parallaxes and is characterized by a 5\% rms uncertainty.
The results suggest a precision in log g of \~{} 0.1 dex, and 0.05-0.10 dex
for the metallicity. There is also reasonable evidence for the
spectroscopic effective temperature scale to be free of systematic
errors; typical uncertainties are assessed to \~{} 80 K. The basic
spectroscopic parameters are supplemented by data for the
microturbulence velocities, the projected rotational velocities, stellar
radii and alpha -enhancement abundances, the latter represented by the
element magnesium. Stellar masses are also given, though many are
probably subject to small adjustments (typically 5\%) in forthcoming
analyses. The well-defined distance correlation is also demonstrated to
be an efficient means for an identification of spectroscopic binaries.
The results are discussed in terms of a spectroscopically established
distance scale, the sites of the stellar populations in the
[Mg/H]-[Fe/Mg] plane, a timescale for the Galactic thin disk, and the
potential of future T$_{eff}$-log g Kiel diagrams for a precise
determination of Galactic globular clusters ages. Based on observations

  Abstract                 = {{Field stars of Population II are among the oldest sources in the Galaxy.
Most of their solar-type dwarfs are non-single and, given their extreme
age, a significant fraction is accompanied by stellar remnants. Here we
report the discovery of the bright F7V star 49 Lib as a massive and very
metal-rich Population II field blue straggler, along with evidence for a
white dwarf as its dark and unseen companion. 49 Lib is known as a
relatively fast-rotating, single-lined spectroscopic binary in a 3 year
orbit and with an apparent age of about {$\tau$} {\sime} 2.3 Gyr. Its
chemistry and kinematics, however, both consistently imply that 49 Lib
must be an ancient Population II star at {$\tau$} {\sime} 12 Gyr. With
reference to the inclination from the astrometric orbit, leading to a
$\{$M$\}$$_{{WD}$$\}$=$\{$0.50$\}$$_{-0.04}$$^{+0.03}$ M
$_{&sun;}$ low-mass white dwarf, and in view of the
$\{$M$\}$$_{{BS}$$\}$=$\{$1.55$\}$$_{-0.13}$$^{+0.07}$ M
$_{&sun;}$ massive, evolved F-type blue straggler star, we
demonstrate that 49 Lib must have been the subject of a mostly
conservative mass transfer with a near-equal-mass M {\sime} 1.06 + 1.00 M
$_{&sun;}$ G-type binary at birth. For its future evolution, we
point to the possibility as a progenitor system toward a type Ia
supernova. Most importantly, however, we note that the remarkable metal
enrichment of 49 Lib at [Mg/H] = +0.23 and [Fe/H] = {\minus}0.11 has
principally very relevant implications for the early epoch when the
Milky Way came into being.

textbook example of this kind with the nearby A-type star {$\alpha$} Lib A.
Although discovered as a spectroscopic binary already in the year 1904,
a radial velocity curve has never been published up to a point where the
existence of the secondary became even suspicious. However, in this
work, we demonstrate that {$\alpha$} Lib A is indeed a double-lined
spectroscopic binary with a rapidly rotating - and hence almost
invisible - A-type primary, accompanied and predominated by a more
slowly rotating late-A or early F-type secondary in an eccentric P =
70.34 d orbit. On account of the shallow absorption lines of the
primary, uncertainties remain with its semi-amplitude and hence the
exact mass ratio. Yet, with a maximal projected separation that should
lie in the range 20 to 25 mas, follow-up high-angular resolution
observations might soon establish {$\alpha$} Lib Aa-Ab as a visual binary,
with a measure for the orbital inclination and precisely determined
stellar masses.

thus most plausibly the result of a former accretion of mass and angular
momentum from the distant degenerate. In consequence, this also implies
that with respect to shorter-period systems, like Sirius or Procyon, one
must expect significant wind accretion when they evolve through the
planetary nebula phase, such that the system ages cannot be reliably
determined from their currently bright primaries.

radial velocity surveys that mostly exclude the case of a blue straggler
primary and a white dwarf secondary. While it is realized that a stellar
merger can principally solve the issue and there is indeed observational
evidence for mass accretion on HR 3138 from the absence of lithium in
its photosphere, we also consider the interesting circumstance that HR
3138 lies in the direction to the 350 pc distant, young open cluster NGC
2516. We point to the possibility that the progenitor cloud of this
cluster may likewise account for former mass accretion and we argue in
particular for a dynamical friction with this cloud as a plausible cause
for the strikingly common Galactic rotational velocity of the field star

the phase-space distribution of their host galaxy's disc. In order to
search for such imprints in the Milky Way, we analyse the Sloan
Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) F/G dwarf
and the Schuster et al. stellar samples. We find similar features in
these two completely independent stellar samples, consistent with the
predictions of a Milky Way minor-merger event. We next apply the same
analyses to high-resolution, idealized N-body simulations of the
interaction between the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the Milky Way. The
energy distributions of stellar particle samples in small spatial
regions in the host disc reveal strong variations of structure with
position. We find good matches to the observations for models with a
mass of Sagittarius' dark matter halo progenitor ?10$^{11}$
M$_{&sun;}$. Thus, we show that this kind of analysis could be
used to provide unprecedentedly tight constraints on Sagittarius'
orbital parameters, as well as place a lower limit on its mass.

  Abstract                 = {{NASA's Kepler mission is providing basic asteroseismic data for hundreds
of stars. One of the more common ways of determining stellar
characteristics from these data is by the so-called grid-based modeling.
We have made a detailed study of grid-based analysis techniques to study
the errors (and error correlations) involved. As had been reported
earlier, we find that it is relatively easy to get very precise values
of stellar radii using grid-based techniques. However, we find that
there are small, but significant, biases that can result because of the
grid of models used. The biases can be minimized if metallicity is
known. Masses cannot be determined as precisely as the radii and suffer
from larger systematic effects. We also find that the errors in mass and
radius are correlated. A positive consequence of this correlation is
that log g can be determined both precisely and accurately with almost
no systematic biases. Radii and log g can be determined with almost no
model dependence to within 5\% for realistic estimates of errors in
asteroseismic and conventional observations. Errors in mass can be
somewhat higher unless accurate metallicity estimates are available. Age
estimates of individual stars are the most model dependent. The errors
are larger, too. However, we find that for star clusters, it is possible
to get a relatively precise age if one assumes that all stars in a given
cluster have the same age.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the
first Gaia data release, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and
photometry for over 1 billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7. <BR
/> Aims: A summary of Gaia DR1 is presented along with illustrations of
the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the
limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. <BR />
Methods: The raw data collected by Gaia during the first 14 months of
the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis
Consortium (DPAC) and turned into an astrometric and photometric
catalogue. <BR /> Results: Gaia DR1 consists of three components: a
primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes,
and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in
common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues - a realisation of the
Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) - and a secondary astrometric
data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources.
The second component is the photometric data set, consisting of mean
G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the
characteristics of 3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high
cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For
the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3
mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas yr$^{-1}$
for the proper motions. A systematic component of 0.3 mas should be
added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of 94 000 Hipparcos
stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise
at about 0.06 mas yr$^{-1}$. For the secondary astrometric data
set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is 10 mas. The median
uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to
 0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. <BR /> Conclusions: Gaia
DR1 is an important milestone ahead of the next Gaia data release, which
will feature five-parameter astrometry for all sources. Extensive
validation shows that Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping
of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin
observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of
this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important
limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered
before drawing conclusions from the data.

  Abstract                 = {{Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the
EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in
2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept
was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the
payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the
scientific community focusses on data processing for which the
international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was
selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at
its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon
system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and
payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission
started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and
subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the
scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built
spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these
goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance
of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the
mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and
findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We
summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit
operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the
data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through
the Gaia home page.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. The first Gaia Data Release contains the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric
Solution (TGAS). This is a subset of about 2 million stars for which,
besides the position and photometry, the proper motion and parallax are
calculated using Hipparcos and Tycho-2 positions in 1991.25 as prior
information. <BR /> Aims: We investigate the scientific potential and
limitations of the TGAS component by means of the astrometric data for
open clusters. <BR /> Methods: Mean cluster parallax and proper motion
values are derived taking into account the error correlations within the
astrometric solutions for individual stars, an estimate of the internal
velocity dispersion in the cluster, and, where relevant, the effects of
the depth of the cluster along the line of sight. Internal consistency
of the TGAS data is assessed. <BR /> Results: Values given for standard
uncertainties are still inaccurate and may lead to unrealistic
unit-weight standard deviations of least squares solutions for cluster
parameters. Reconstructed mean cluster parallax and proper motion values
are generally in very good agreement with earlier Hipparcos-based
determination, although the Gaia mean parallax for the Pleiades is a
significant exception. We have no current explanation for that
discrepancy. Most clusters are observed to extend to nearly 15 pc from
the cluster centre, and it will be up to future Gaia releases to
establish whether those potential cluster-member stars are still
dynamically bound to the clusters. <BR /> Conclusions: The Gaia DR1
provides the means to examine open clusters far beyond their more easily
visible cores, and can provide membership assessments based on proper
motions and parallaxes. A combined HR diagram shows the same features as
observed before using the Hipparcos data, with clearly increased
luminosities for older A and F dwarfs.

  Abstract                 = {{We have implemented a simple model to identify the likely sites of the
first stars and galaxies in the high-resolution simulations of the
formation of galactic dark matter haloes of the Aquarius Project. The
first star in a galaxy like the Milky Way formed around redshift z = 35;
by z = 10, the young galaxy contained up to \~{}3 {\times} 10$^{4}$
dark matter haloes capable of forming stars by molecular hydrogen
cooling. These minihaloes were strongly clustered, and feedback may have
severely limited the actual number of Population III stars that formed.
By the present day, the remnants of the first stars would be strongly
concentrated to the centre of the main halo. If a second generation of
long-lived stars formed near the first (the first star relics), we would
expect to find half of them within 30 h$^{-1}$kpc of the Galactic
Centre and a significant fraction in satellites where they may be
singled out by their anomalous metallicity patterns. The first halo in
which gas could cool by atomic hydrogen line radiation formed at z = 25;
by z = 10, the number of such `first galaxies' had increased to \~{}300.
Feedback might have decreased the number of first galaxies at the time
when they undergo significant star formation, but not the number that
survive to the present because near neighbours merge. Half of all the
`first galaxies' that formed before z = 10 merge with the main halo
before z \~{} 3 and most lose a significant fraction of their mass.
However, today there should still be more than 20 remnants orbiting
within the central \~{}30h$^{-1}$kpc of the Milky Way. These
satellites have circular velocities of a few kilometres per second or
more, comparable to those of known Milky Way dwarfs. They are a
promising hunting ground for the remnants of the earliest epoch of star
formation.

helium in the metallicity range Z$_{&sun;}$/4 $\lt$ Z $\lt$ 2
Z$_{&sun;}$. Our AGB models, with diffusive overshooting from all
the convective borders, predict that O is overproduced in low-Z low-mass
({\tilde}1-3 M$_{&sun;}$) AGB stars and nicely reproduce the recent
O overabundances observed in C-rich dust PNe. This confirms that O is
not always a good proxy of the original ISM metallicity and other
chemical elements such as Cl or Ar should be used instead. The
production of oxygen by low-mass stars should be thus considered in
galactic-evolution models.

  Abstract                 = {{The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) has
built the largest moderately high-resolution (R {\ap} 22,500)
spectroscopic map of the stars across the Milky Way, and including
dust-obscured areas. The APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical
Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) is the software developed for the automated
analysis of these spectra. ASPCAP determines atmospheric parameters and
chemical abundances from observed spectra by comparing observed spectra
to libraries of theoretical spectra, using {$\chi$}$^{2}$
minimization in a multidimensional parameter space. The package consists
of a fortran90 code that does the actual minimization and a wrapper IDL
code for book-keeping and data handling. This paper explains in detail
the ASPCAP components and functionality, and presents results from a
number of tests designed to check its performance. ASPCAP provides
stellar effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities
precise to 2\%, 0.1 dex, and 0.05 dex, respectively, for most APOGEE
stars, which are predominantly giants. It also provides abundances for
up to 15 chemical elements with various levels of precision, typically
under 0.1 dex. The final data release (DR12) of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey III contains an APOGEE database of more than 150,000 stars.
ASPCAP development continues in the SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 survey.

  Abstract                 = {{Given the potential of ensemble asteroseismology for understanding
fundamental properties of large numbers of stars, it is critical to
determine the accuracy of the scaling relations on which these
measurements are based. From several powerful validation techniques, all
indications so far show that stellar radius estimates from the
asteroseismic scaling relations are accurate to within a few percent.
Eclipsing binary systems hosting at least one star with detectable
solar-like oscillations constitute the ideal test objects for validating
asteroseismic radius and mass inferences. By combining radial velocity
(RV) measurements and photometric time series of eclipses, it is
possible to determine the masses and radii of each component of a
double-lined spectroscopic binary. We report the results of a four-year
RV survey performed with the {\'e}chelle spectrometer of the
Astrophysical Research Consortium{\rsquo}s 3.5 m telescope and the APOGEE
spectrometer at Apache Point Observatory. We compare the masses and
radii of 10 red giants (RGs) obtained by combining radial velocities and
eclipse photometry with the estimates from the asteroseismic scaling
relations. We find that the asteroseismic scaling relations overestimate
RG radii by about 5\% on average and masses by about 15\% for stars at
various stages of RG evolution. Systematic overestimation of mass leads
to underestimation of stellar age, which can have important implications
for ensemble asteroseismology used for Galactic studies. As part of a
second objective, where asteroseismology is used for understanding
binary systems, we confirm that oscillations of RGs in close binaries
can be suppressed enough to be undetectable, a hypothesis that was
proposed in a previous work.

{$\alpha$}-elements (Mg, Si, Ca) for 75 Galactic Cepheids. The abundances
are based on high spectral resolution (R\~{} 38 000) and high
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N \~{} 50-300) spectra collected with UVES at ESO
VLT. The current measurements were complemented with Cepheid abundances
provided by our group (75) or available in the literature, for a total
of 439 Galactic Cepheids. Special attention was given to providing a
homogeneous abundance scale for these five elements plus iron. In
addition, accurate Galactocentric distances (R$_{G}$) based on
near-infrared photometry are also available for all the Cepheids in the
sample. They cover a large section of the Galactic thin disk (4.1
{\le}R$_{G}${\le} 18.4 kpc). We found that these five elements
display well-defined linear radial gradients and modest standard
deviations over the entire range of R$_{G}$. Moreover, the
[element/Fe] abundance ratios are constant across the entire thin disk;
only the Ca radial distribution shows marginal evidence of a positive
slope. These results indicate that the chemical enrichment history of
iron and of the quoted five elements has been quite similar across the
four quadrants of the Galactic thin disk. The [element/Fe] ratios are
also constant over the entire period range. This empirical evidence
indicates that the chemical enrichment of Galactic Cepheids has also
been very homogenous within the range in age that they cover (\~{}10-300
Myr). Once again, [Ca/Fe] vs. log P shows a (negative) gradient, since
it is underabundant among the youngest Cepheids. Finally, we also find
that Cepheid abundances agree quite well with similar abundances for
thin and thick disk dwarf stars, and they follow the typical Mg-Al and
Na-O correlations.

  Abstract                 = {{Characterizing the physical properties of exoplanets and understanding
their formation and orbital evolution requires precise and accurate
knowledge of their host stars. Accurately measuring stellar masses is
particularly important because they likely influence planet occurrence
and the architectures of planetary systems. Single main-sequence stars
typically have masses estimated from evolutionary tracks, which
generally provide accurate results due to their extensive empirical
calibration. However, the validity of this method for subgiants and
giants has been called into question by recent studies, with suggestions
that the masses of these evolved stars could have been overestimated. We
investigate these concerns using a sample of 59 benchmark evolved stars
with model-independent masses (from binary systems or asteroseismology)
obtained from the literature. We find very good agreement between these
benchmark masses and the ones estimated using evolutionary tracks. The
average fractional difference in the mass interval {\tilde}0.7-4.5
M$_{&sun;}$ is consistent with zero (-1.30 {\plusmn} 2.42\%),
with no significant trends in the residuals relative to the input
parameters. A good agreement between model-dependent and -independent
radii (-4.81 {\plusmn} 1.32\%) and surface gravities (0.71 {\plusmn}
0.51\%) is also found. The consistency between independently determined
ages for members of binary systems adds further support for the accuracy
of the method employed to derive the stellar masses. Taken together, our
results indicate that determination of masses of evolved stars using
grids of evolutionary tracks is not significantly affected by systematic
errors, and is thus valid for estimating the masses of isolated stars
beyond the main sequence.

  Abstract                 = {{Star clusters are often used as tracers of major star-formation events
in external galaxies as they can be studied out to much greater
distances than individual stars. It is vital to understand their
evolution if they are used to derive, for example, the star-formation
history of their host galaxy. More specifically, we want to know how
cluster lifetimes depend on their environment and on structural
properties such as mass and radius. This review presents a theoretical
overview of the early evolution of star clusters and the consequent
long-term survival chances. It is suggested that clusters forming with
initial densities of {\gsim}10$^{4}$ M$_{&sun;}$
pc$^{-3}$ survive the gas expulsion, or {\lsquo}infant
mortality,{\rsquo} phase. At \~{}10Myr, they are bound and have densities of
\~{}10$^{3�1}$ M$_{&sun;}$ pc$^{-3}$. After this
time, they are stable against expansion through stellar evolution,
encounters with giant molecular clouds and will most likely survive for
another Hubble time if they are located in a moderate tidal field.
Clusters with lower initial densities ({\lsim}100 M$_{&sun;}$
pc$^{-3}$) will disperse into the field within a few 10s of Myrs.
Some discussion is given on how extragalactic star cluster populations,
and especially their age distributions, can be used to gain insight into
disruption.

evolve and lose mass. We show that for clusters with short initial
relaxation time scales ({\le}100 Myr) the dynamical expansion is largely
powered by mass loss from stars in the core, but happens on a relaxation
time scale. That is, the energy release following stellar mass loss is
in balance with the amount of energy that is transported outward by
two-body relaxation.

shrouded in mystery. They could have formed similarly to young massive
clusters (YMCs) that we see forming today in starburst environments; or
they may have formed in more exotic environments before the assembly of
their host galaxy. The pristine properties of GCs are affected by a
Hubble time of dynamical evolution and this needs to be understood if we
want to derive the initial properties of GCs. The evolution of GCs can
only be modelled forward in time and this makes the exploration of the
initial conditions of GCs challenging. We present an extremely fast
method (about 1000 cluster models per second, with an effort that is
independent of N) to solve for the evolution of a restricted number of
GC properties. The code (Evolve Me A Cluster of StarS, EMACSS) is used
in a Bayesian analyses of the initial conditions of the Milky Way GC
population. We find that the best fit initial properties of Milky Way
GCs are different than those of YMCs forming today: the GC mass function
is flatter (i.e. less low-mass clusters) and their densities are higher.

low-mass, young stellar objects (YSOs) in the solar neighbourhood is
approximately log-normal. The authors conclude that the star formation
process is hierarchical and that only a small fraction of stars form in
dense star clusters. Here, we show that the peak and the width of the
density distribution are also what follow if all stars form in bound
clusters which are not significantly affected by the presence of gas and
expand by two-body relaxation. The peak of the surface density
distribution is simply obtained from the typical ages (few Myr) and
cluster membership number (few hundred) typifying nearby star-forming
regions. This result depends weakly on initial cluster sizes, provided
that they are sufficiently dense (initial half mass radius of {\lsim}0.3
pc) for dynamical evolution to be important at an age of a few Myr. We
conclude that the degeneracy of the YSO surface density distribution
complicates its use as a diagnostic of the stellar formation
environment.

feature present in the color-magnitude diagrams of nearby galaxy
systems: the red clump (RC). This feature has given rise to a series of
methods aimed at measuring the distributions of stellar distances and
extinctions, especially in the Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way Bulge.
Because the RC is easily recognizable within the data of large
spectroscopic and asteroseismic surveys, it is a useful probe of stellar
densities, kinematics, and chemical abundances across the Milky Way
disk; it can be applied up to larger distances than that allowed by
dwarfs; and it has better accuracy than is possible with other kinds of
giants. Here, we discuss the reasons for the RC narrowness in several
sets of observational data, its fine structure, and the presence of
systematic changes in the RC properties as regards age, metallicity, and
the observed passband. These factors set the limits on the validity and
accuracy of several RC methods defined in the literature.

tables of bolometric corrections. The resulting formulas can be applied
to any photometric system, provided that the zero-points are specified
by means of either ABmag, STmag, VEGAmag, or a standard star system that
includes well-known spectrophotometric standards. Interstellar
absorption can be considered in a self-consistent way. (2) We assemble
an extended and updated library of stellar intrinsic spectra. It is
mostly based on ``non-overshooting'' ATLAS9 models, suitably extended to
both low and high effective temperatures. This offers an excellent
coverage of the parameter space of T\_eff, log g, and [M/H]. We briefly
discuss the main uncertainties and points still deserving more
improvement. (3) From the spectral library, we derive tables of
bolometric corrections for Johnson-Cousins-Glass, HST/WFPC2, HST/NICMOS,
Washington, and ESO Imaging Survey systems (this latter consisting on
the WFI, EMMI, and SOFI filter sets). (4) These tables are used to
convert several sets of Padova isochrones into the corresponding
absolute magnitudes and colours, thus providing a useful database for
several astrophysical applications. All data files are made available in
electronic form.

Sun-like stars. Stellar dynamos, however, are poorly understood owing to
the scarcity of observations of rotation and magnetic fields in stars.
Here, inferences are drawn on the internal rotation of a distant
Sun-like star by studying its global modes of oscillation. We report
asteroseismic constraints imposed on the rotation rate and the
inclination of the spin axis of the Sun-like star HD 52265, a principal
target observed by the CoRoT satellite that is known to host a planetary
companion. These seismic inferences are remarkably consistent with an
independent spectroscopic observation (rotational line broadening) and
with the observed rotation period of star spots. Furthermore,
asteroseismology constrains the mass of exoplanet HD 52265b. Under the
standard assumption that the stellar spin axis and the axis of the
planetary orbit coincide, the minimum spectroscopic mass of the planet
can be converted into a true mass of 1.85 (+0.52,-0.42) M\_Jupiter, which
implies that it is a planet, not a brown dwarf.

  Abstract                 = {{The Milky Way bulge offers a unique opportunity to investigate in detail
the role that different processes such as dynamical instabilities,
hierarchical merging, and dissipational collapse may have played in the
history of the Galaxy formation and evolution based on its resolved
stellar population properties. Large observation programs and surveys of
the bulge are providing for the first time a look into the global view
of the Milky Way bulge that can be compared with the bulges of other
galaxies, and be used as a template for detailed comparison with models.
The Milky Way has been shown to have a boxy/peanut (B/P) bulge and
recent evidence seems to suggest the presence of an additional
spheroidal component. In this review we summarize the global chemical
abundances, kinematics and structural properties that allow us to
disentangle these multiple components and provide constraints to
understand their origin. The investigation of both detailed and global
properties of the bulge now provide us with the opportunity to
characterize the bulge as observed in models, and to place the mixed
component bulge scenario in the general context of external galaxies.
When writing this review, we considered the perspectives of researchers
working with the Milky Way and researchers working with external
galaxies. It is an attempt to approach both communities for a fruitful
exchange of ideas.

the Galactic bulge using large spatial coverage to constrain the bulge
formation scenario. <BR /> Methods: We use the VISTA variables in the
Via Lactea (VVV) survey data and 2MASS photometry, which cover 320 sqdeg
of the Galactic bulge, to derive photometric metallicities by
interpolating the (J - Ks)$_{0}$ colors of individual red giant
branch stars based on a set of globular cluster ridge lines. We then use
this information to construct the first global metallicity map of the
bulge with a resolution of 30' {\times} 45'. <BR /> Results: The
metallicity map of the bulge revealed a clear vertical metallicity
gradient of \~{}0.04 dex/deg (\~{}0.28 dex/kpc), with metal-rich stars ([Fe/H]
\~{} 0) dominating the inner bulge in regions closer to the Galactic plane
(|b| {\lt} 5). At larger scale heights, the mean metallicity of the bulge
population becomes significantly more metal poor. <BR /> Conclusions:
This fits in the scenario of a boxy bulge originating from the vertical
instability of the Galactic bar, formed early via secular evolution of a
two-component stellar disk. Older metal-poor stars dominate at higher
scale heights due to the non-mixed orbits of originally hotter thick
disk stars.

  Abstract                 = {{The finding of a double red clump in the luminosity function of the
Milky Way bulge has been interpreted as evidence for an X-shaped
structure. Recently, an alternative explanation has been suggested,
where the double red clump is an effect of multiple stellar populations
in a classical spheroid. In this Letter we provide an observational
assessment of this scenario and show that it is not consistent with the
behaviour of the red clump across different lines of sight, particularly
at high distances from the Galactic plane. Instead, we confirm that the
shape of the red clump magnitude distribution closely follows the
distance distribution expected for an X-shaped bulge at critical
Galactic latitudes. We also emphasize some key observational properties
of the bulge red clump that should not be neglected in the search for

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: We investigate metallicity and {$\alpha$}-element abundance

with the aim of providing observational constraints for the structure

22 500) spectra for 400 K giants, in four fields within -4.8{\deg} {\lsim}
b {\lsim} -3.4{\deg} and -10{\deg} {\lsim} l {\lsim} +10{\deg}, were obtained
within the GIRAFFE Inner Bulge Survey (GIBS) project. To this sample we
added another \~{}400 stars in Baade's Window at (l,b) = (1{\deg},-4{\deg}),
observed with the identical instrumental configuration: FLAMES GIRAFFE
in Medusa mode with HR13 setup. All target stars lie within the red
clump of the bulge colour-magnitude diagram, thus minimising
contamination from the disc or halo stars. The spectroscopic stellar
surface parameters were derived with an automatic method based on the
GALA code, while the [Ca/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] abundances as a function of
[Fe/H] were derived through a comparison with the synthetic spectra
using MOOG. We constructed the metallicity distributions for the entire
sample, and for each field individually, in order to investigate the
presence of gradients or field-to-field variations in the shape of the
distributions. <BR /> Results: The metallicity distributions in the five
fields are consistent with being drawn from a single parent population,
indicating the absence of a gradient along the major axis of the
Galactic bar. The global metallicity distribution is nicely fitted by
two Gaussians. The metal-poor component is rather broad, with a mean at
{\mlab} [Fe/H] {\mrab} = -0.31 dex and {$\sigma$} = 0.31 dex. The metal-rich
component is narrower, with mean {\mlab} [Fe/H] {\mrab} = + 0.26 and
{$\sigma$} = 0.2 dex. The [Mg/Fe] ratio follows a tight trend with [Fe/H],
with enhancement with respect to solar in the metal-poor regime similar
to the value observed for giant stars in the local thick disc. [Ca/Fe]
abundances follow a similar trend, but with a considerably larger
scatter than [Mg/Fe]. A decrease in [Mg/Fe] is observed at [Fe/H] =
-0.44 dex. This knee is in agreement with our previous bulge study of
K-giants along the minor axis, but is 0.1 dex lower in metallicity than
the value reported for the microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars in the
bulge. We found no variation in {$\alpha$}-element abundance distributions
between different fields.

  Abstract                 = {{Like Hipparcos, Gaia is designed to give absolute parallaxes,
independent of any astrophysical reference system. And indeed, Gaia's
internal zero-point error for parallaxes is likely to be smaller than
any individual parallax error. Nevertheless, due in part to mechanical
issues of unknown origin, there are many astrophysical questions for
which the parallax zero-point error $\sigma(\pi\_0)$ will be the
fundamentally limiting constraint. These include the distance to the
Large Magellanic Cloud and the Galactic Center. We show that by using
the photometric parallax estimates for RR Lyrae stars (RRL) within 8kpc,
via the ultra-precise infrared period-luminosity relation, one can
independently determine a hyper-precise value for $\pi\_{0}$. Despite
their paucity relative to bright quasars, we show that RRL are
competitive due to their order-of-magnitude improved parallax precision
for each individual object relative to bright quasars. We show that this
method is mathematically robust and well-approximated by analytic
formulae over a wide range of relevant distances.

CoRoT and Kepler provides a powerful means of testing the modeling of
transport processes in stars. Rotational splittings are currently
measured for a large number of red giant stars and can provide stringent
constraints on the rotation profiles. The aim of this paper is to obtain
a theoretical framework for understanding the properties of the observed
rotational splittings of red giant stars with slowly rotating cores.
This allows us to establish appropriate seismic diagnostics for the
rotation of these evolved stars. Rotational splittings were computed for
stochastically excited dipolar modes by adopting a first-order
perturbative approach for two 1.3 M$_{&sun;}$ benchmark models
that assume slowly rotating cores. For red giant stars with slowly
rotating cores, we show that the variation in the rotational splittings
of {\ell} = 1 modes with frequency depends only on the large frequency
separation, the g-mode period spacing, and the ratio of the average
envelope to core rotation rates ({\#8475}). This led us to propose a way
to infer directly {\#8475} from the observations. This method is
validated using the Kepler red giant star KIC 5356201. Finally, we
provide theoretical support for using a Lorentzian profile to measure
the observed splittings for red giant stars.

  Abstract                 = {{The stellar disk of the Milky Way shows complex spatial and abundance
structure that is central to understanding the key physical mechanisms
responsible for shaping our Galaxy. In this study, we use six very high
resolution cosmological zoom simulations of Milky Way-sized haloes - the
Auriga simulations - to study the prevalence and formation of chemically
distinct disc components. We find that our simulations develop a clearly
bimodal distribution in the $[\rm \alpha/Fe]$ -- $[\rm Fe/H]$ plane. We
find two main pathways to creating this dichotomy which operate in
different regions of the galaxies: a) an early ($z\gt1$) and intense
high-$\rm[\alpha/Fe]$ star formation phase in the inner region
($R\lesssim 5$ kpc) induced by gas-rich mergers, followed by more
quiescent low-$\rm[\alpha/Fe]$ star formation; and b) an early phase of
high-$\rm[\alpha/Fe]$ star formation in the outer disc followed by a
contraction and re-expansion of the gas disc owing to a temporary
decrease in gas accretion rate. In process b), a double-peaked star
formation history around the time and radius of disc contraction
accentuates the dichotomy. Simulations in which the early phase of star
formation is prolonged rather than short and intense follow the same
sequence as process a) in the inner region, but the dichotomy becomes
less clear. In the outer region, the abundance bimodality is only
evident if the first intense burst of star formation covers a large
enough radial range before disc contraction occurs; otherwise, the outer
disc consists of only low-$\rm[\alpha/Fe]$ sequence stars. We discuss
the implication that both processes occurred in the Milky Way.

haloes. These were carried out with the moving mesh code arepo, together
with a comprehensive model for galaxy formation physics, including
active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and magnetic fields, which
produces realistic galaxy populations in large cosmological simulations.
We demonstrate that our simulations reproduce a wide range of
present-day observables, in particular, two-component disc-dominated
galaxies with appropriate stellar masses, sizes, rotation curves, star
formation rates and metallicities. We investigate the driving mechanisms
that set present-day disc sizes/scalelengths, and find that they are
related to the angular momentum of halo material. We show that the
largest discs are produced by quiescent mergers that inspiral into the
galaxy and deposit high-angular momentum material into the pre-existing
disc, simultaneously increasing the spin of dark matter and gas in the
halo. More violent mergers and strong AGN feedback play roles in
limiting disc size by destroying pre-existing discs and by suppressing
gas accretion on to the outer disc, respectively. The most important
factor that leads to compact discs, however, is simply a low angular
momentum for the halo. In these cases, AGN feedback plays an important
role in limiting central star formation and the formation of a massive
bulge.

  Abstract                 = {{We show that in {\ss}rm N-body simulations of isolated spiral discs,
spiral arms appear to transient, recurring features that co-rotate with
the stellar disc stars at all radii. As a consequence, stars around the
spiral arm continually feel a tangential force from the spiral and
gain/lose angular momentum at all radii where spiral structure exists,
without gaining significant amounts of random energy. We demonstrate
that the ubiquitous radial migration in these simulations can be seen as
outward (inward) systematic streaming motions along the trailing
(leading) side of the spiral arms. We characterise these spiral induced
peculiar motions and compare with those of the Milky Way obtained from
APOGEE red clump data. We find that transient, co-rotating spiral arms
are consistent with the data, in contrast with density wave-like spirals
which are qualitatively inconsistent. In addition, we show that, in our
simulations, radial migration does not change the radial metallicity
gradient significantly, and broadens the metallicity distribution
function at all radii, similar to some previous studies.

  Abstract                 = {{Radial migration is defined as the change in guiding centre radius of
stars and gas caused by gains or losses of angular momentum that result
from gravitational interaction with non-axisymmetric structure. This has
been shown to have significant impact on the metallicity distribution in
galactic discs, and therefore affects the interpretation of Galactic
archaeology. We use a simulation of a Milky Way-sized galaxy to examine
the effect of radial migration on the star and gas radial metallicity
distribution. We find that both the star and gas component show
significant radial migration. The stellar radial metallicity gradient
remains almost unchanged but the radial metallicity distribution of the
stars is broadened to produce a greater dispersion at all radii.
However, the metallicity dispersion of the gas remains narrow. We find
that the main drivers of the gas metallicity distribution evolution are
metal enrichment and mixing: more efficient metal enrichment in the
inner region maintains a negative slope in the radial metallicity
distribution, and the metal mixing ensures the tight relationship of the
gas metallicity with the radius. The metallicity distribution function
reproduces the trend in the age-metallicity relation found from
observations for stars younger than 1.0 Gyr in the Milky Way.

pattern speed in order to avoid the winding dilemma. The pattern is
consequently a rigidly rotating, long-lived feature. We run N-body
simulations of a giant disc galaxy consisting of a pure stellar disc and
a static dark matter halo, and find that the spiral arms are transient
features whose pattern speeds decrease with radius in such a way that
the pattern speed is almost equal to the rotation curve of the galaxy.
We trace particle motion around the spiral arms. We show that particles
from behind and in front of the spiral arm are drawn towards and join
the arm. Particles move along the arm in the radial direction and we
find a clear trend that they migrate towards the outer (inner) radii on
the trailing (leading) side of the arm. Our simulations demonstrate that
because the spiral arm feature is corotating, the particles continue to
be accelerated (decelerated) by the spiral arm for long periods, which
leads to strong and efficient migration, at all radii in the disc.

can generate such a distribution, which is likely to depend on the
assembly history of the galaxy. To this end, we perform 16
high-resolution cosmological-zoom simulations of Milky Way-sized
galaxies using the state-of-the-art cosmological magnetohydrodynamical
code AREPO, and analyse the evolution of the vertical kinematics of the
stellar disc in connection with various heating mechanisms. We find that
the bar is the dominant heating mechanism in most cases, whereas spiral
arms, radial migration and adiabatic heating from mid-plane density
growth are all subdominant. The strongest source, though less prevalent
than bars, originates from external perturbations from
satellites/subhaloes of masses log$_{10}$(M/M$_{&sun;}$)
{\gsim} 10. However, in many simulations the orbits of newborn star
particles become cooler with time, such that they dominate the shape of
the age-velocity dispersion relation and overall vertical disc structure
unless a strong external perturbation takes place.

arms. For the first time, we demonstrate that spiral arms, that form in
a disc in a fully cosmological environment with realistic galaxy
formation physics, drive large-scale systematic streaming motions. In
particular, on the trailing edge of the spiral arms the peculiar
galactocentric radial and azimuthal velocity field is directed radially
outward and azimuthally backward, whereas it is radially inward and
azimuthally forward on the leading edge. Owing to the negative radial
metallicity gradient, this systematic motion drives, at a given radius,
an azimuthal variation in the residual metallicity that is characterized
by a metal-rich trailing edge and a metal-poor leading edge. We show
that these signatures are theoretically observable in external galaxies
with integral field unit instruments such as VLT/MUSE, and if detected,
would provide evidence for large-scale systematic radial migration
driven by spiral arms.

covering three-quarters of the sky out to a distance of several
kiloparsecs, based on Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) and 2MASS photometry. The map
reveals a wealth of detailed structure, from filaments to large cloud
complexes. The map has a hybrid angular resolution, with most of the map
at an angular resolution of 3$\backslash$buildrel$\{$ $\backslash$prime$\}$$\backslash$over$\{$.$\}$
4-13$\backslash$buildrel$\{$ $\backslash$prime$\}$$\backslash$over$\{$.$\}$ 7, and a maximum distance
resolution of {\tilde} 25\%. The three-dimensional distribution of dust is
determined in a fully probabilistic framework, yielding the uncertainty
in the reddening distribution along each line of sight, as well as
stellar distances, reddenings, and classifications for 800 million stars
detected by PS1. We demonstrate the consistency of our reddening
estimates with those of two-dimensional emission-based maps of dust
reddening. In particular, we find agreement with the Planck $\{${$\tau$}
$\}$$_{353{GHz}$$\}$-based reddening map to within 0.05 $\{$mag$\}$ in E(B-V)
to a depth of 0.5 $\{$mag$\}$, and explore systematics at reddenings less than
E(B-V){\ap} 0.08 $\{$mag$\}$. We validate our per-star reddening estimates by
comparison with reddening estimates for stars with both Sloan Digital
Sky Survey photometry and Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and
Exploration spectral classifications, finding per-star agreement to
within 0.1 $\{$mag$\}$ out to a stellar E(B-V) of 1 mag. We compare our map to
two existing three-dimensional dust maps, by Marshall et al. and
Lallement et al., demonstrating our finer angular resolution, and better
distance resolution compared to the former within {\tilde} 3 $\{$kpc$\}$. The map
can be queried or downloaded at <A href=''http://argonaut.skymaps.info''>http://argonaut.skymaps.info</A>. We
expect the three-dimensional reddening map presented here to find a wide
range of uses, among them correcting for reddening and extinction for
objects embedded in the plane of the Galaxy, studies of Galactic
structure, calibration of future emission-based dust maps, and
determining distances to objects of known reddening.

Galaxy by comparing detailed chemical evolution models with recent data
from the AMBRE Project. The data suggest that the stars in the thick and
thin discs form two distinct sequences with the thick disc stars showing
higher [$\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$/Fe] ratios. We adopt two different approaches to model
the evolution of thick and thin discs. In particular, we adopt: i) a
two-infall approach where the thick disc forms fast and before the thin
disc and by means of a fast gas accretion episode, whereas the thin disc
forms by means of a second accretion episode on a longer timescale; ii)
a parallel approach, where the two discs form in parallel but at
different rates. By comparing our model results with the observed
[Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] and the metallicity distribution functions in the two
Galactic components, we conclude that the parallel approach can account
for a group of $\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$-enhanced metal rich stars present in the data,
whereas the two-infall approach cannot explain these stars unless they
are the result of stellar migration. In both approaches, the thick disc
has formed on a timescale of accretion of 0.1 Gyr, whereas the thin disc
formed on a timescale of 7 Gyr in the solar region. In the two-infall
approach a gap in star formation between the thick and thin disc
formation of several hundreds of Myr should be present, at variance with
the parallel approach where no gap is present.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. CoRoT and Kepler observations of red giant stars revealed very
rich spectra of non-radial solar-like oscillations. Of particular
interest was the detection of mixed modes that exhibit significant
amplitude, both in the core and at the surface of the stars. It opens
the possibility of probing the internal structure from their innermost
layers up to their surface throughout their evolution on the red giant
branch, as well as on the red clump. <BR /> Aims: Our objective is
primarily to provide physical insight into the mechanism responsible for
mixed-mode amplitudes and lifetimes. Subsequently, we aim at
understanding the evolution and structure of red-giant spectra along
with their evolution. The study of energetic aspects of these
oscillations is also important for predicting the mode parameters in the
power spectrum. <BR /> Methods: Non-adiabatic computations, including a
time-dependent treatment of convection, are performed and provide the
lifetimes of radial and non-radial mixed modes. We then combine these
mode lifetimes and inertias with a stochastic excitation model that
gives us their heights in the power spectra. <BR /> Results: For stars
representative of CoRoT and Kepler observations, we show under which
circumstances mixed modes have heights comparable to radial ones. We
stress the importance of the radiative damping in determining the height
of mixed modes. Finally, we derive an estimate for the height ratio
between a g-type and a p-type mode. This can thus be used as a first
estimate of the detectability of mixed modes.

  Abstract                 = {{The scaling relations between global asteroseismic observables and
stellar properties are widely used to estimate masses and radii of stars
exhibiting solar-like oscillations. Since the mass and radius of the Sun
are known independently, the Sun is commonly used as a reference to
scale to. However, the validity of the scaling relations depends on the
homology between the star under study and the reference star. Solar-like
oscillators span a wide range of masses and metallicities, as well as
evolutionary phases. Most of these stars are therefore not homologous to
the Sun. This leads to errors of up to 10\% (5\%) in mass (radius) when
using the asteroseismic scaling relations with the Sun as the reference.
In this paper we derive a reference function to replace the
solar-reference value used in the large-frequency-separation scaling
relation. Our function is the first that depends on both effective
temperature and metallicity, and is applicable from the end of the main
sequence to just above the bump on the red giant branch. This reference
function improves the estimates of masses and radii determined through
scaling relations by a factor of 2, i.e. allows masses and radii to be
recovered with an accuracy of 5\% and 2\%, respectively.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. The chemical evolution of lithium in the Milky Way represents a
major problem in modern astrophysics. Indeed, lithium is, on the one
hand, easily destroyed in stellar interiors, and, on the other hand,
produced at some specific stellar evolutionary stages that are still not
well constrained. <BR /> Aims: The goal of this paper is to investigate
the lithium stellar content of Milky Way stars in order to put
constraints on the lithium chemical enrichment in our Galaxy, in
particular in both the thin and thick discs. <BR /> Methods: Thanks to
high-resolution spectra from the ESO archive and high quality
atmospheric parameters, we were able to build a massive and homogeneous
catalogue of lithium abundances for 7300 stars derived with an automatic
method coupling, a synthetic spectra grid, and a Gauss-Newton algorithm.
We validated these lithium abundances with literature values, including
those of the Gaia benchmark stars. <BR /> Results: In terms of lithium
galactic evolution, we show that the interstellar lithium abundance
increases with metallicity by 1 dex from [M/H] = -1 dex to + 0.0 dex.
Moreover, we find that this lithium ISM abundance decreases by about 0.5
dex at super-solar metalllicity. Based on a chemical separation, we also
observed that the stellar lithium content in the thick disc increases
rather slightly with metallicity, while the thin disc shows a steeper
increase. The lithium abundance distribution of {$\alpha$}-rich, metal-rich
stars has a peak at A$_{Li}$ \~{} 3 dex. <BR /> Conclusions: We
conclude that the thick disc stars suffered of a low lithium chemical
enrichment, showing lithium abundances rather close to the Spite plateau
while the thin disc stars clearly show an increasing lithium chemical
enrichment with the metallicity, probably thanks to the contribution of
low-mass stars.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Understanding the history and the evolution of the Milky Way is
one of the main goals of modern astrophysics. In particular, the
formation of the Galactic disc is a key problem of Galactic archaeology.
<BR /> Aims: We study the velocity dispersion behaviour of Galactic disc
stars as a function of the [Mg/Fe] ratio, which for small metallicity
bins can be used as a proxy of relative age. This key relation is
essential to constrain the formation mechanisms of the disc stellar
populations as well as the cooling and settling processes. <BR />
Methods: We used the recommended parameters and chemical abundances of
7800 FGK Milky Way field stars from the second internal data release of
the Gaia-ESO spectroscopic Survey. These stars were observed with the
GIRAFFE spectrograph (HR10 and HR21 setups), and cover a large spatial
volume in the intervals 6 $\lt$R$\lt$ 10 kpc and | Z | $\lt$ 2 kpc. Based
on a chemical criterion, we separated the thin- from the thick-disc
sequence in the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane. <BR /> Results: From analysing
the Galactocentric velocity of the stars for the thin disc, we find a
weak positive correlation between V$_{phi}$ and [Fe/H] that is
due to a slowly rotating [Fe/H]-poor tail. For the thick disc stars, a
strong correlation with [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] is established. In addition,
we have detected an inversion of the velocity dispersion trends with
[Mg/Fe] for thick-disc stars with [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.10 dex and [Mg/Fe] $\gt$
+0.20 dex for the radial component. First, the velocity dispersion
increases with [Mg/Fe] at all [Fe/H] ratios for the thin-disc stars, and
then it decreases for the thick-disc population at the highest [Mg/Fe]
abundances. Similar trends are observed for several bins of [Mg/Fe]
within the errors for the azimuthal velocity dispersion, while a
continuous increase with [Mg/Fe] is observed for the vertical velocity
dispersion. The velocity dispersion decrease agrees with previous
measurements of the RAVE survey, although it is observed here for a
greater metallicity interval and a larger spatial volume. <BR />
Conclusions: Thanks to the Gaia-ESO Survey data, we confirm the
existence of [Mg/Fe]-rich thick-disc stars with cool kinematics in the
generally turbulent context of the primitive Galactic disc. This is
discussed in the framework of the different disc formation and evolution
scenarios.

Digital Sky Survey. The camera consists of two arrays, a photometric
array that uses 30 2048 x 2048 SITe/Tektronix CCDs (24 {$\mu$}m pixels)
with an effective imaging area of 720 cm\^{}2 and an astrometric array that
uses 24 400 x 2048 CCDs with the same pixel size, which will allow us to
tie bright astrometric standard stars to the objects imaged in the
photometric camera. The instrument will be used to carry out photometry
essentially simultaneously in five color bands spanning the range
accessible to silicon detectors on the ground in the
time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) scanning mode. The photometric detectors
are arrayed in the focal plane in six columns of five chips each such
that two scans cover a filled stripe 2.5d wide. This paper presents
engineering and technical details of the camera.

Tycho Catalogue (hereafter Tycho-1) collected by the sky mapper of the
ESA Hipparcos satellite, but Tycho-2 is much bigger and slightly more
precise, owing to a more advanced reduction technique. Components of
double stars with separations down to 0.8 arcsec are included. Proper
motions precise to about 2.5 mas/yr are given as derived from a
comparison with the Astrographic Catalogue and 143$\backslash$ other astrometric
catalogues, all reduced to the Hipparcos celestial coordinate system.
Tycho-2 supersedes in most applications Tycho-1, and the ACT and TRC
catalogues based on Tycho-1. Based on observations made with the ESA
Hipparcos astrometry satellite.

  Abstract                 = {{We present an extensive peakbagging effort on Kepler data of $\sim$50
red giant stars in the open star cluster NGC 6819. By employing
sophisticated pre-processing of the time series and Markov Chain Monte
Carlo techniques we extracted individual frequencies, heights and
linewidths for hundreds of oscillation modes. We show that the ``average''
asteroseismic parameter $\delta\nu\_{02}$, derived from these, can be
used to distinguish the stellar evolutionary state between the red giant
branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars. Masses and radii are
estimated using asteroseismic scaling relations, both empirically
corrected to obtain self-consistency as well as agreement with
independent measures of distance, and using updated theoretical
corrections. Remarkable agreement is found, allowing the evolutionary
state of the giants to be determined exclusively from the empirical
correction to the scaling relations. We find a mean mass of the RGB
stars and RC stars in NGC 6819 to be $1.61\pm0.02\,\textrm{M}\_\odot$ and
$1.64{\pm}0.02\,\textrm{M}\_\odot$, respectively. The difference $\Delta
M=-0.03\pm0.01\,\textrm{M}\_\odot$ is almost insensitive to systematics,
suggesting very little RGB mass loss, if any. Stars that are outliers
relative to the ensemble reveal overmassive members that likely evolved
via mass-transfer in a blue straggler phase. We suggest that KIC
4937011, a low-mass Li-rich giant, is a cluster member in the RC phase
that experienced very high mass-loss during its evolution. Such over-
and undermassive stars need to be considered when studying field giants,
since the true age of such stars cannot be known and there is currently
no way to distinguish them from normal stars.

was redesigned as the K2 mission, pointing towards the ecliptic and
delivering data for new fields approximately every 80 days. The steady
flow of data obtained with a reduced pointing stability calls for
dedicated pipelines for extracting light curves and correcting these for
use in, e.g., asteroseismic analysis. <BR /> Aims: We provide corrected
light curves for the K2 fields observed until now (campaigns 0-4), and
provide a comparison with other pipelines for K2 data
extraction/correction. <BR /> Methods: Raw light curves are extracted
from K2 pixel data using the ``K2-pixel-photometry'' (K2P$^{2}$)
pipeline, and corrected using the KASOC filter. <BR /> Results: The use
of K2P$^{2}$ allows for the extraction of the order of 90 000
targets in addition to 70 000 targets proposed by the community - for
these, other pipelines provide no data. We find that K2P$^{2}$ in
general performs as well as, or better than, other pipelines for the
tested metrics of photometric quality. In addition to stars, pixel masks
are properly defined using K2P$^{2}$ for extended objects such as
galaxies for which light curves are also extracted.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. The APOGEE survey has obtained high-resolution infrared spectra
of more than 100 000 stars. Deriving chemical abundances patterns of
these stars is paramount to piecing together the structure of the Milky
Way. While the derived chemical abundances have been shown to be precise
for most stars, some calibration problems have been reported, in
particular for more metal-poor stars. <BR /> Aims: In this paper, we aim
to (1) re-determine the chemical abundances of the APOGEE+Kepler stellar
sample (APOKASC) with an independent procedure, line list and line
selection, and high-quality surface gravity information from
asteroseismology; and (2) extend the abundance catalogue by including
abundances that are not currently reported in the most recent APOGEE
release (DR12). <BR /> Methods: We fixed the T$_{eff}$ and log g
to those determined using spectrophotometric and asteroseismic
techniques, respectively. We made use of the Brussels Automatic Stellar
Parameter (BACCHUS) code to derive the metallicity and broadening
parameters for the APOKASC sample. In addition, we derived differential
abundances with respect to Arcturus. <BR /> Results: We have validated
the BACCHUS code on APOGEE data using several well-known stars, and
stars from open and globular clusters. We also provide the abundances of
C, N, O, Mg, Ca, Si, Ti, S, Al, Na, Ni, Mn, Fe, K, and V for every star
and line, and show the impact of line selection on the final abundances.
Improvements have been made for some elements (e.g. Ti, Si, V).
Additionally, we measure new abundance ratios not found in the current
APOGEE release including P, Cu, Rb, and Yb, which are only upper limits
at this time, as well as Co and Cr which are promising. <BR />
Conclusions: In this paper, we present an independent analysis of the
APOKASC sample and provide abundances of up to 21 elements. This
catalogue can be used not only to study chemical abundance patterns of
the Galaxy but also to train data driven spectral approaches which can
improve the abundance precision in a restricted dataset, but also full
APOGEE sample.

Release 12, we measure the distribution of stars in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe]
versus [Fe/H] plane and the metallicity distribution functions (MDFs)
across an unprecedented volume of the Milky Way disk, with radius 3 {\lt}
R {\lt} 15 kpc and height | z| $\backslash$lt 2 kpc. Stars in the inner disk (R {\lt}
5 kpc) lie along a single track in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H], starting
with {$\alpha$}-enhanced, metal-poor stars and ending at [{$\alpha$}/Fe] {\sim}
0 and [Fe/H] {\sim} +0.4. At larger radii we find two distinct sequences
in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H] space, with a roughly solar-{$\alpha$}
sequence that spans a decade in metallicity and a high-{$\alpha$} sequence
that merges with the low-{$\alpha$} sequence at super-solar [Fe/H]. The
location of the high-{$\alpha$} sequence is nearly constant across the disk
however, there are very few high-{$\alpha$} stars at R {\gt} 11 kpc. The
peak of the midplane MDF shifts to lower metallicity at larger R,
reflecting the Galactic metallicity gradient. Most strikingly, the shape
of the midplane MDF changes systematically with radius, from a
negatively skewed distribution at 3 {\lt} R {\lt} 7 kpc, to a roughly
Gaussian distribution at the solar annulus, to a positively skewed shape
in the outer Galaxy. For stars with | z| $\backslash$gt 1 kpc or [{$\alpha$}/Fe] {\gt}
0.18, the MDF shows little dependence on R. The positive skewness of the
outer-disk MDF may be a signature of radial migration; we show that
blurring of stellar populations by orbital eccentricities is not enough
to explain the reversal of MDF shape, but a simple model of radial
migration can do so.

  Abstract                 = {{The analysis of the kinematics of solar neighbourhood stars shows that
the low- and high-metallicity tails of the thin disc are populated by
objects which orbital properties suggest an origin in the outer and
inner Galactic disc, respectively. Signatures of radial migration are
identified in various recent samples, and are shown to be responsible
for the high-metallicity dispersion in the age-metallicity distribution.
Most importantly, it is shown that the population of low-metallicity
wanderers of the thin disc (-0.7 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.3 dex) is also
responsible for the apparent hiatus in metallicity with the thick disc
(which terminal metallicity is about -0.2 dex). It implies that the thin
disc at the solar circle has started to form stars at about this same
metallicity. This is also consistent with the fact that `transition'
objects, which have {$\alpha$}-element abundance intermediate between that
of the thick and thin discs, are found in the range [-0.4, -0.2] dex.
Once the metal-poor thin disc stars are recognized for what they are -
wanderers from the outer thin disc - the parenthood between the two
discs can be identified on stars genuinely formed at the solar circle
through an evolutionary sequence in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Fe/H]. Another
consequence is that stars that can be considered as truly resulting of
the chemical evolution at the solar circle have a metallicity restricted
to about [-0.2, +0.2] dex, confirming an old idea that most chemical
evolution in the Milky Way have preceded the thin disc formation.

  Abstract                 = {{I review the uncertainties in two observational local constraints of the
Galactic disc chemical evolution: the metallicity distribution of
long-lived dwarfs and the age-metallicity relation. Analysing most
recent data, it is shown first that the observed metallicity
distribution at solar galactocentric radius, designed with standard
methods, is more fit to a closed-box model than to the infall
metallicity distribution. We argue that this is due to the specific
contribution of the thick-disc population, which has been overlooked
both in the derivation of the observed metallicity distribution and in
the standard chemical evolution models. Although this agreement
disqualifies the metallicity distribution as the best supportive
(indirect) evidence for infall, we argue that the evolution must be more
complex than described by either the closed-box or the standard infall
models.

It is then shown that recent determinations of the age-metallicity
distribution (AMD) from large Str{\"o}mgren photometric surveys are
dominated by noise resulting from systematic biases in metallicities and
effective temperatures. These biases are evaluated and a new AMD is
obtained, where particularities of the previous determinations are
phased out. The new age-metallicity relation shows a mean increase
limited to about a factor of 2 in Z over the disc age. It is shown that
below 3 Gyr, the dispersion in metallicity is about 0.1 dex, which,
given the observational uncertainties in the derived metallicities, is
compatible with the small cosmic dispersion measured on the interstellar
medium and meteoritic pre-solar dust grains. A population that is
progressively older and more metal rich arises at a metallicity greater
than that of the Hyades, to reach [Fe/H] \~{} +0.5 dex at ages greater than
5 Gyr. We suggest that this is best explained by radial migration. A
symmetrical widening of the metallicity interval towards lower values is
seen at about the same age, which is attributed to a similar cause.
Finally, the new derived ages are sufficiently consistent that an
age-metallicity relation within the thick disc is confirmed. These new
features altogether draw a picture of the chemical evolution in the
solar neighbourhood where dynamical effects and complexity in the AMD
dominate, rather than a generalized high dispersion at all ages.

neighbourhood. This distribution is centred on solar metallicity. We
show that previous metallicity distributions, selected on the basis of
spectral type, are biased against stars with solar metallicity or
higher. A selection of G-dwarf stars is inherently biased against
metal-rich stars and is not representative of the solar neighbourhood
metallicity distribution. Using a sample selected on colour, we obtain a
distribution where approximately half the stars in the solar
neighbourhood have metallicities higher than [Fe/H]=0. The percentage of
mid-metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]$\lt$-0.5) is approximately 4 per cent, in
agreement with present estimates of the thick disc. In order to have a
metallicity distribution comparable to chemical evolution model
predictions, we convert the star fraction to mass fraction, and show
that another bias against metal-rich stars affects dwarf metallicity
distributions, due to the colour (or spectral type) limits of the
samples. Reconsidering the corrections resulting from the increasing
thickness of the stellar disc with age, we show that the simple
closed-box model with no instantaneous recycling approximation gives a
reasonable fit to the observed distribution. Comparisons with the
age-metallicity relation and abundance ratios suggest that the simple
closed-box model may be a viable model of the chemical evolution of the
Galaxy at solar radius.

  Abstract                 = {{We show that the bulge and the disk of the Milky Way (MW) at
R$\lesssim$7\~{}kpc are well described by a unique chemical evolution and a
two-phase star-formation history (SFH). We argue that the populations
within this inner disk, not the entire disk, are the same, and that the
outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) of the bar plays a key role in explaining
this uniformity. In our model of a two-phase star formation history, the
metallicity, [$\alpha$/Fe] and [$\alpha$/H] distributions, and
age-metallicity relation are all compatible with the observations of
both the inner disk and bulge. The dip at [Fe/H]$\sim$0 dex seen in the
metallicity distributions of the bulge and inner disk reflects the
quenching episode in the SFH of the inner MW at age $\sim$8 Gyr, and the
common evolution of the bulge and inner disk stars. We show that at
z$\le$1.5, when the MW was starting to quench, transitioning between the
end of the $\alpha$-enhanced thick disk formation to the start of the
thin disk, and yet was still gas rich, the gas accretion rate could not
have been significant. The [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratio before and
after this quenching phase would be different, which is not observed.
The present analysis suggests that Milky Way history, and in particular
at the transition from the thick to the thin disk -- the epoch of the
quenching -- must have been driven by a decrease of the star formation
efficiency. We argue that the decline in the intensity of gas accretion,
the formation of the bar, and the quenching of the SFR at the same epoch
may be causally connected thus explaining their temporal coincidence
(abridged).

show that the small dispersion in abundances of {$\alpha$}-elements at all
ages provides evidence that the star formation history (SFH) has been
uniform throughout the thick disk. In the context of long-timescale
infall models, we suggest that this result points either to a limited
dependence of the gas accretion on the Galactic radius in the inner disk
(R$\lt$ 10 kpc) or to a decoupling of the accretion history and SFH due
to other processes governing the interstellar medium in the early disk,
suggesting that infall cannot be a determining parameter of the chemical
evolution at these epochs. We argue that these results and other recent
observational constraints - namely the lack of radial metallicity
gradient and the non-evolving scale length of the thick disk - are
better explained if the early disk is viewed as a pre-assembled gaseous
system, with most of the gas settled before significant star formation
took place - formally the equivalent of a closed-box model. In either
case, these results point to a weak or non-existent inside-out formation
history in the thick disk or in the first 3-5 Gyr of the formation of
the Galaxy. We argue, however, that the growing importance of an
external disk whose chemical properties are distinct from those of the
inner disk would give the impression of an inside-out growth process
when seen through snapshots at different epochs. The progressive,
continuous process usually invoked may not have actually existed in the
Milky Way.

  Abstract                 = {{Quenching, the cessation of star formation, is one of the most
significant events in the life cycle of galaxies. While quenching is
generally thought to be linked to their central regions, the mechanism
responsible for it is not known and may not even be unique. We show here
the first evidence that the Milky Way experienced a generalised
quenching of its star formation at the end of its thick-disk formation
\~{}9 Gyr ago. The fossil record imprinted on the elemental abundances of
stars studied in the solar vicinity and as part of the APOGEE survey
(APOGEE is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III) reveals indeed that
in less than \~{}2 Gyr (from 10 to 8 Gyr ago) the star formation rate in
our Galaxy dropped by an order of magnitude. Because of the tight
correlation that exists between age and {$\alpha$} abundance, the general
cessation of the star formation activity reflects in the dearth of stars
along the inner-disk sequence in the [Fe/H]-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] plane. Before
this phase, which lasted about 1.5 Gyr, the Milky Way was actively
forming stars. Afterwards, the star formation resumed at a much lower
level to form the thin disk. These events observed in our Galaxy are
very well matched by the latest observation of MW-type progenitors at
high redshifts. In late-type galaxies, the quenching mechanism is
believed to be related to a long and secular exhaustion of gas. Our
results show that in the Milky Way, the shut-down occurred on a much
shorter timescale, while the chemical continuity between the stellar
populations formed before and after the quenching indicates that it is
not the exhaustion of the gas that was responsible for the cessation of
the star formation. While quenching is generally associated with
spheroids in the literature, our results show that it also occurs in
galaxies like the Milky Way, where the classical bulge is thought to be
small or non-existent, possibly when they are undergoing a morphological
transition from thick to thin disks. Given the demographics of late-type
galaxies in the local Universe, in which classical bulges are rare, we
suggest further that this may hold true generally in galaxies with mass
lower than or approximately of M$^{*}$, where quenching
could directly be a consequence of thick-disk formation, while quenching
may be related to development of spheroids in higher mass galaxies. We
emphasize that the quenching phase in the Milky Way could be
contemporaneous with, and related to, the formation of the bar, at the
end of the thick-disk phase. We sketch a scenario on how a strong bar
may inhibit star formation.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Open clusters are an important tool for studying the chemical
evolution of the Galactic disk. Metallicity estimates are available for
about ten percent of the currently known open clusters. These
metallicities are based on widely differing methods, however, which
introduces unknown systematic effects. <BR /> Aims: In a series of three
papers, we investigate the current status of published metallicities for
open clusters that were derived from a variety of photometric and
spectroscopic methods. The current article focuses on spectroscopic
methods. The aim is to compile a comprehensive set of clusters with the
most reliable metallicities from high-resolution spectroscopic studies.
This set of metallicities will be the basis for a calibration of
metallicities from different methods. <BR /> Methods: The literature was
searched for [Fe/H] estimates of individual member stars of open
clusters based on the analysis of high-resolution spectra. For
comparison, we also compiled [Fe/H] estimates based on spectra with low
and intermediate resolution. At medium and high resolution, we found
that differences in the analysis methods have a stronger effect on the
metallicity than that of quality differences in the observations. We
retained only highly probable cluster members and introduced a
restriction on atmospheric parameters. <BR /> Results: We combined 641
individual metallicity values for 458 stars in 78 open clusters from 86
publications to form our final set of high-quality cluster
metallicities. The photometric metallicities discussed in the first
paper of this series are systematically lower than the spectroscopic
ones by about 0.1 dex, and the differences show a scatter of about 0.2
dex. In a preliminary comparison of our spectroscopic sample with models
of Galactic chemical evolution, none of the models predicts the observed
radial metallicity gradient. <BR /> Conclusions: Photometric
metallicities show a large intrinsic dispersion, while the more accurate
spectroscopic sample presented in this paper comprises fewer than half
the number of clusters. Only a sophisticated combination of all
available photometric and spectroscopic data will allow us to trace the
metallicity distribution in the Galactic disk on a local and global
scale.

near-interrupted high-precision photometric timeseries observations from

evolved stars, including red giants. These inferences are confronted
with predictions from theoretical models to improve our understanding of
stellar structure and evolution. Our knowledge and understanding of red
giants have indeed increased tremendously using these seismic
inferences, and we anticipate that more information is still hidden in

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Observations during the first long run (\~{}150 days) in the
exo-planet field of CoRoT increase the number of G-K giant stars for
which solar-like oscillations are observed by a factor of 100. This
opens the possibility to study the characteristics of their oscillations
in a statistical sense. <BR />Aims: We aim to understand the
statistical distribution of the frequencies of maximum oscillation power
({$\nu$}\_max) in red giants and to search for a possible correlation
between {$\nu$}\_max and the large separation ({$\Delta$} {$\nu$}). <BR
/>Methods: Red giants with detectable solar-like oscillations are
identified using both semi-automatic and manual procedures. For these
stars, we determine {$\nu$}\_max as the centre of a Gaussian fit to the
oscillation power excess. For the determination of {$\Delta$} {$\nu$}, we use
the autocorrelation of the Fourier spectra, the comb response function
and the power spectrum of the power spectrum. <BR />Results: The
resulting {$\nu$}\_max distribution shows a pronounced peak between 20-40
{$\mu$}Hz. For about half of the stars we obtain {$\Delta$} {$\nu$} with at least
two methods. The correlation between {$\nu$}\_max and {$\Delta$} {$\nu$} follows
the same scaling relation as inferred for solar-like stars. <BR
/>Conclusions: The shape of the {$\nu$}\_max distribution can partly be
explained by granulation at low frequencies and by white noise at high
frequencies, but the population density of the observed stars turns out
to be also an important factor. From the fact that the correlation
between {$\Delta$} {$\nu$} and {$\nu$}\_max for red giants follows the same
scaling relation as obtained for sun-like stars, we conclude that the
sound travel time over the pressure scale height of the atmosphere
scales with the sound travel time through the whole star irrespective of
evolution. The fraction of stars for which we determine {$\Delta$} {$\nu$}
does not correlate with {$\nu$}\_max in the investigated frequency range,
which confirms theoretical predictions.

  Abstract                 = {{The hierarchical structure formation model predicts that stellar halos
should form, at least partly, via mergers. If this was a predominant
formation channel for the Milky Way's halo, imprints of this merger
history in the form of moving groups or streams should exist also in the
vicinity of the Sun. Here we study the kinematics of halo stars in the
Solar neighbourhood using the very recent first data release from the
Gaia mission, and in particular the TGAS dataset, in combination with
data from the RAVE survey. Our aim is to determine the amount of
substructure present in the phase-space distribution of halo stars that
could be linked to merger debris. To characterise kinematic
substructure, we measure the velocity correlation function in our sample
of halo (low metallicity) stars. We also study the distribution of these
stars in the space of energy and two components of the angular momentum,
in what we call ''Integrals of Motion'' space. The velocity correlation
function reveals substructure in the form of an excess of pairs of stars
with similar velocities, well above that expected for a smooth
distribution. Comparison to cosmological simulations of the formation of
stellar halos indicate that the levels found are consistent with the
Galactic halo having been built fully via accretion. Similarly, the
distribution of stars in the space of ''Integrals of motion'' is highly
complex. A strikingly high fraction (between 58\% and upto 84\%) of the
stars that are somewhat less bound than the Sun are on (highly)
retrograde orbits. A simple comparison to Milky Way-mass galaxies in
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations suggests that less than 1\% have
such prominently retrograde outer halos. We also identify several other
statistically significant structures in ''Integrals of Motion'' space that
could potentially be related to merger events.

self-calibration technique that takes advantage of the simultaneous
availability of spatial and spectral information. In 4 of the 5 objects
we find no significant traces of extended Ly\$$\backslash$alpha\$ emission beyond the
contribution of the QSO nuclei itself, while in UM 247 there is evidence
for a weak and spatially quite compact excess in the Ly\$$\backslash$alpha\$ line at
several kpc outside the nucleus. For all objects in our sample we
estimated detection limits for extended, smoothly distributed Ly\$$\backslash$alpha\$
emission by adding fake nebulosities into the datacubes and trying to
recover them after PSF subtraction. Our observations are consistent with
other studies showing that giant Ly\$$\backslash$alpha\$ nebulae such as those found
recently around some quasars are very rare. Ly\$$\backslash$alpha\$ fuzz around
typical radio-quiet QSOs is fainter, less extended and is therefore much
harder to detect. The faintness of these structures is consistent with
the idea that radio-quiet QSOs typically reside in dark matter haloes of
modest masses.

  Abstract                 = {We present a new implementation of the infrared flux method (IRFM) using the 2MASS catalogue. We compute the theoretical quantities in the 2MASS JHKs filters by integrating theoretical fluxes computed from ATLAS models, and compare them directly with the observed 2MASS JHKs magnitudes. This is the main difference between our implementation of the IRFM and that of Ramirez & Melendez, since to introduce new stars at the lowest metallicities they transform the 2MASS JHKs magnitudes into the TCS photometric system. We merge in our sample the dwarfs stars from Alonso and collaborators with the stars in the sample of Ramirez & Melendez, Casagrande et al., Christlieb et al. and Bonifacio et al. The final number of stars in our sample is 555 dwarf and subgiant field stars, and 264 giant field stars. We derive a new bolometric flux calibration using the available Johnson-Cousins UBVRI and the 2MASS JHKs photometry. We also compute new Teff versus colour empirical calibrations using our extended sample of stars. We derive effectives temperatures for almost all the stars in the Alonso et al. sample and find that our scales of temperature are hotter by ~64K(dT=104K,N=332 dwarfs) and ~54K(dT=131K,N=202 giants). The same comparison with the sample of Ramirez & Melendez for stars with [Fe/H]<-2.5 provides a difference of ~-87K(dT=194K,N=12 dwarfs) and ~61K(dT=62K,N=18 giants). Our temperature scale is slightly hotter than that of Alonso et al. and Ramirez & Melendez for metal-rich dwarf stars but cooler than that of Ramirez & Melendez for metal-poor dwarfs. We have performed a fully self-consistent IRFM in the 2MASS photometric system. For those who wish to use 2MASS photometry and colour-temperature calibrations to derive effective temperatures, especially for metal-poor stars, we recommend our calibrations.},

  Abstract                 = {{To capitalize on a diverse set of large spectroscopic stellar surveys,
measured stellar parameters must be precise and made consistent across
surveys. Here, we demonstrate that this can be achieved by a data-driven
approach to spectral modeling: we use The Cannon (Ness et al. 2015) to
measure precise stellar parameters from the spectra of 450,000 LAMOST
giants, using a model built from APOGEE spectra. The Cannon fits a
predictive model for LAMOST spectra using a reference set of 9952 stars
observed in common between the two surveys, taking five ASPCAP labels
from APOGEE DR12 (Garcia Perez et al. 2015) as ground truth: Teff, logg,
[Fe/H], [$\alpha$/M], and K-band extinction $A\_k$. The model is then
used to infer Teff, logg, [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/M] for 454,180 giant
stars in LAMOST DR2, roughly 20\% of the total LAMOST DR2 stellar sample.
By construction, these labels are on the APOGEE label scale. Thus, this
''label transfer'' enables us to tie low-resolution ($R \sim 1800$) LAMOST
spectra to the label scale of a much higher-resolution (APOGEE $R \sim
22,500$) survey. We find that these new Cannon labels have an accuracy
and precision comparable to the stated APOGEE DR12 values and
uncertainties, dramatically reducing the existing systematic label
inconsistencies resulting from the individual survey pipelines. By
transferring [$\alpha$/M] labels from APOGEE, The Cannon produces the
first [$\alpha$/M] values measured from LAMOST spectra, and the largest
catalog of [alpha/M] for giant stars to date. This demonstrates that The
Cannon can successfully bring different surveys onto the same label
scale by transferring a label system from one survey to another.

reference set comprises 8125 stars observed in common between the APOGEE

ground truth: Teff, logg, [M/H], [$\alpha$/M], [C/M], [N/M], and Ak. We
add seven colors to the Cannon model, based on the g, r, i, J, H, K, W1,
and W2 magnitudes from APASS, 2MASS {\amp} WISE, which improves our
constraints on Teff and logg by up to 20\% and on Ak by up to 70\%.
Cross-validation of the model demonstrates that, for high-SNR objects,
our inferred labels agree with the APOGEE values to within 50 K in
temperature, 0.04 magnitudes in Ak, and $\lt$ 0.1 dex in logg, [M/H],
[C/M], [N/M], and [$\alpha$/M]. We apply the model to 450,000 giants in
LAMOST DR2 that have not been observed by APOGEE. This demonstrates that
precise individual abundances can be measured from low-resolution
spectra, and represents the largest catalog of [C/M], [N/M], masses and
ages to date. As as result, we greatly increase the number and sky
coverage of stars with mass and age estimates.

  Abstract                 = {{The Tycho-2 Catalogue is an astrometric reference catalogue containing
positions and proper motions as well as two-colour photometric data for
the 2.5 million brightest stars in the sky. The Tycho-2 positions and
magnitudes are based on precisely the same observations as the original
Tycho Catalogue (hereafter Tycho-1; see Cat. {\lt}I/239{\gt})) collected
by the star mapper of the ESA Hipparcos satellite, but Tycho-2 is much
bigger and slightly more precise, owing to a more advanced reduction
technique. Components of double stars with separations down to 0.8
arcsec are included. Proper motions precise to about 2.5 mas/yr are
given as derived from a comparison with the Astrographic Catalogue and
143 other ground-based astrometric catalogues, all reduced to the
Hipparcos celestial coordinate system. Tycho-2 supersedes in most
applications Tycho-1, as well as the ACT (Cat. {\lt}I/246{\gt}) and TRC
(Cat. {\lt}I/250{\gt}) catalogues based on Tycho-1. Supplement-1 lists
stars from the Hipparcos and Tycho-1 Catalogues which are not in
Tycho-2. Supplement-2 lists 1146 Tycho-1 stars which are probably either
false or heavily disturbed. For more information, please consult the
Tycho-2 home page: http://www.astro.ku.dk/\~{}erik/Tycho-2 (4 data files).

  Abstract                 = {{We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to
data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points
in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is
only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points
have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the
uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these
conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general,
heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties,
and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown
uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear
relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having
a ''generative model'' for the data, even an approximate one. Once there
is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because
the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters
or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior
probability distribution is indispensible if there are ''nuisance
parameters'' to marginalize away.

  Abstract                 = {{Chemical tagging promises to use detailed abundance measurements to
identify spatially separated stars that were, in fact, born together (in
the same molecular cloud) long ago. This idea has not yielded much
practical success, presumably because of the noise and incompleteness in
chemical-abundance measurements. We have succeeded in substantially
improving spectroscopic measurements with The Cannon, which has now
delivered 15 individual abundances for {\tilde} $\{$10$\}$$^{5}$ stars
observed as part of the APOGEE spectroscopic survey, with precisions
around 0.04 dex. We test the chemical-tagging hypothesis by looking at
clusters in abundance space and confirming that they are clustered in
phase space. We identify (by the k-means algorithm) overdensities of
stars in the 15-dimensional chemical-abundance space delivered by The
Cannon, and plot the associated stars in phase space. We use only
abundance-space information (no positional information) to identify
stellar groups. We find that clusters in abundance space are indeed
clusters in phase space, and we recover some known phase-space clusters
and find other interesting structures. This is the first-ever project to
identify phase-space structures at the survey-scale by blind search
purely in abundance space; it verifies the precision of the abundance
measurements delivered by The Cannon the prospects for future data sets
appear very good.

spectrograph, which collects high-resolution (R {\tilde} 22,500), near-IR
(1.51-1.70 {$\mu$}m) spectra with a multiplexing (300 fiber-fed
objects) capability. We describe the survey data products that are
publicly available, which include catalogs with radial velocity, stellar
parameters, and 15 elemental abundances for over 150,000 stars, as well
as the more than 500,000 spectra from which these quantities are
derived. Calibration relations for the stellar parameters
($\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, $\{$log$\}$ g, [M/H], [{$\alpha$}/M]) and abundances (C, N,
O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni) are presented and
discussed. The internal scatter of the abundances within clusters
indicates that abundance precision is generally between 0.05 and 0.09
dex across a broad temperature range; it is smaller for some elemental
abundances within more limited ranges and at high signal-to-noise ratio.
We assess the accuracy of the abundances using comparison of mean
cluster metallicities with literature values, APOGEE observations of the
solar spectrum and of Arcturus, comparison of individual star abundances
with other measurements, and consideration of the locus of derived
parameters and abundances of the entire sample, and find that it is
challenging to determine the absolute abundance scale; external accuracy
may be good to 0.1-0.2 dex. Uncertainties may be larger at cooler
temperatures ($\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$ $\backslash$lt 4000 $\{$$\{$K$\}$$\}$). Access to the
public data release and data products is described, and some guidance
for using the data products is provided.

  Abstract                 = {{The Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project explores the role
of feedback in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Previous
FIRE simulations used an identical source code (FIRE-1) for consistency.
Now, motivated by the development of more accurate numerics
(hydrodynamic solvers, gravitational softening, supernova coupling) and
the exploration of new physics (e.g. magnetic fields), we introduce
FIRE-2, an updated numerical implementation of FIRE physics for the
GIZMO code. We run a suite of simulations and show FIRE-2 improvements
do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties relative to FIRE-1.
We then pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics in galaxy
simulations. Details of the star-formation (SF) algorithm, cooling
physics, and chemistry have weak effects, provided that we include
metal-line cooling and SF occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We
present several new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy
simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are remarkably robust to the
numerics that we test, provided that: (1) Toomre masses (cold disk scale
heights) are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation and
isotropy, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. As resolution
increases, stellar masses and profiles converge first, followed by metal
abundances and visual morphologies, then properties of winds and the
circumgalactic medium. The central (\~{}kpc) mass concentration of massive
(L*) galaxies is sensitive to numerics, particularly how winds ejected
into hot halos are trapped, mixed, and recycled into the galaxy.
Multiple feedback mechanisms are required to reproduce observations: SNe
regulate stellar masses; OB/AGB mass loss fuels late-time SF; radiative
feedback suppresses instantaneous SFRs and accretion onto dwarfs. We
provide tables, initial conditions, and the numerical algorithms
required to reproduce our simulations.

evolution of the Milky Way disk, we study the evolution of the
abundances of the elements He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar and Fe. We
use metallicity dependent yields for massive stars with and without mass
loss. We find that most observed abundance profiles are correctly
reproduced by massive star yields, but C and N require supplementary
sources. We argue that massive, mass losing stars can totally account
for the abundance profile of C, while intermediate mass stars are the
main source of N; in both cases, some conflict with corresponding data
on extragalactic HII regions arises, at least if current observations in
the Galaxy are taken at face value. The observed behaviour of Al is
marginally compatible with current massive star yields, which probably
overestimate the ``odd-even'' effect. We also find that the adopted
``inside-out'' formation scheme for the Milky Way disk produces
abundance profiles steeper in the past. The corresponding abundance
scatter is smaller in the inner disk than in the outer regions for a
given interval of Galactic age.

  Abstract                 = {{Results from the ongoing Bulge Radial Velocity Assay (BRAVA) are
presented. BRAVA uses M red giant stars, selected from the 2MASS catalog
to lie within a bound of reddening-corrected color and luminosity, as
targets for the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 4 m Hydra
multiobject spectrograph. Three years of observations investigate the
kinematics of the Galactic bulge major (-10{\deg} $\lt$ l $\lt$ +
10{\deg}, b = - 4{\deg}) and minor (-6{\deg} $\lt$ b $\lt$ +
5{\deg}, -0.4{\deg} $\lt$ l $\lt$ 0.0{\deg}) axes with \~{}3300 radial
velocities from 32 bulge fields and one disk field. We construct a
longitude-velocity plot for the bulge stars and find that, contrary to
previous studies, the bulge does not rotate as a solid body; from
-4{\deg} $\lt$ l $\lt$ + 4{\deg} the rotation curve has a slope of
roughly 100 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and flattens
considerably at greater l, reaching a maximum rotation of 75 km
s$^{-1}$. We compare our rotation curve and velocity
dispersion profile both to the self-consistent model of Zhao and to
N-body models; neither fits both our observed rotation curve and
velocity dispersion profile. We place the bulge on the plot of
V$_{max}$/{$\sigma$} vs. epsilon and find that the bulge lies near
the oblate rotator line and very close to the parameters of NGC 4565, an
edge-on spiral galaxy with a bulge similar to that of the Milky Way. We
find that our summed velocity distribution of bulge stars appears to be
sampled from a Gaussian distribution, with {$\sigma$} = 116 +/- 2 km
s$^{-1}$ for our full data set. Two candidate cold streams
are not confirmed with additional data.

distance accuracy selected from the LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey of the
Galactic Anti-center (LSS-GAC), we study the radial and vertical
gradients of the Galactic disk(s) mainly in the anti-center direction,
covering a significant volume of the disk in the range of projected
Galactocentric radius 7 {\le} R$_{GC}$ {\le} 14 kpc and height from
the Galactic midplane 0 {\le} |Z| {\le} 3 kpc. Our analysis shows that
both the radial and vertical metallicity gradients are negative across
much of the volume of the disk that is probed, and they exhibit
significant spatial variations. Near the solar circle (7 {\le}
R$_{GC}$ {\le} 115 kpc), the radial gradient has a moderately
steep, negative slope of -0.08 dex kpc$^{-1}$ near the
midplane (|Z| $\lt$ 0.1 kpc), and the slope flattens with increasing |Z|.
In the outer disk (11.5 $\lt$ R$_{GC}$ {\le} 14 kpc), the radial
gradients have an essentially constant, much less steep slope of
-0.01 dex kpc$^{-1}$ at all heights above the plane,
suggesting that the outer disk may have experienced an evolutionary path
different from that of the inner disk. The vertical gradients are found
to flatten largely with increasing R$_{GC}$. However, the vertical
gradient of the lower disk (0 {\le} |Z| {\le} 1 kpc) is found to flatten
with R$_{GC}$ quicker than that of the upper disk (1 $\lt$ |Z| {\le}
3 kpc). Our results should provide strong constraints on the theory of
disk formation and evolution, as well as the underlying physical
processes that shape the disk (e.g. gas flows, radial migration, and
internal and external perturbations).

  Abstract                 = {{This contribution gives the results of a statistical investigation of
400 extragalactic nebulae for which Holetschek has determined total
visual magnitudes. The list is complete for the brighter nebulae in the
northern sky and is representative to 12.5 mag. or fainter. The
classification employed is based on the forms of the photographic
images. About 3 per cent are irregular, but the remaining nebulae fall
into a sequence of type forms characterized by rotational symmetry about
dominating nuclei. The sequence is composed of two sections, the
elliptical nebulae and the spirals, which merge into each other.
Luminosity relations. - The distribution of magnitudes appears to be
uniform throughout the sequence. For each type or stage in the sequence,
the total magnitudes are related to the logarithms of the maximum
diameters by the formula, m$_{T}$ = C - 5 log d, where C varies
progressively from type to type, indicating a variation in diameter for
a given magnitude or vice versa. By applying corrections to C, the
nebulae can be reduced to a standard type and then a single formula
expresses the relation for all nebulae from the Magellanic Clouds to the
faintest that can be classified. When the minor diameter is used, the
value of C is approximately constant throughout the entire sequence. The
coefficient of log d corresponds with the inverse-square law, which
suggests that the nebulae are all of the same order of absolute
luminosity and that apparent magnitudes are measures of distance. This
hypothesis is supported by similar results for the nuclear magnitudes
and the magnitudes of the brightest stars involved, and by the small
range in luminosities among nebulae whose distances are already known.
Distances and absolute dimensions. - The mean absolute visual magnitude,
as derived from the nebulae whose distances are known, is -15.2. The
statistical expression for the distance in parsecs is then log D = 4.04
+ 0.2 m$_{T}$. where m$_{T}$ is the total apparent
magnitude. This leads to mean values for absolute dimensions at various
stages in the sequence of types. Masses appear to be of the order of
2.6x10$^{8}$ M$_{sun}$. Distribution and density of space. -
To apparent magnitude about 16.7, corresponding to an exposure of one
hour on fast plates with the 60-inch reflector, the numbers of nebulae
to various limits of total magnitude vary directly with the volumes of
space represented by the limits. This indicates an approximately uniform
density of space, of the order of one nebula per 10$^{17}$ cubic
parsecs or 1.5x10$^{-31}$ in C.G.S. units. The corresponding
radius of curvature of the finite universe of general relativity is of
the order of 2.7x10$^{10}$ parsecs, or about 600 times the
distance at which normal nebulae can be detected with the 100-inch
reflector.

evolutionary models, we test asteroseismic scaling relations for the
frequency of maximum power ({$\nu$}$_{max}$), the large frequency
separation ({$\Delta$}{$\nu$}), and oscillation amplitudes. We show that the
difference of the {$\Delta$}{$\nu$}-{$\nu$}$_{max}$ relation for unevolved
and evolved stars can be explained by different distributions in
effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with what is
expected from scaling relations. For oscillation amplitudes, we show
that neither (L/M)$^{ s }$ scaling nor the revised scaling
relation by Kjeldsen {\amp} Bedding is accurate for red-giant stars, and
demonstrate that a revised scaling relation with a separate
luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculate amplitudes from the
main sequence to red giants to a precision of \~{}25\%. The residuals show
an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that an
additional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the
observed amplitudes. We investigate correlations between amplitudes and
stellar activity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude
suppression is most pronounced for subgiant stars. Finally, we test the
location of the cool edge of the instability strip in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram using solar-like oscillations and find the
detections in the hottest stars compatible with a domain of hybrid
stochastically excited and opacity driven pulsation.

lower {$\nu$}$_{max}$, in agreement with models predicting more
efficient mode trapping in stars with higher luminosity. We investigate
the offset epsilon in the asymptotic relation and find a clear
correlation with {$\Delta$}{$\nu$}, demonstrating that it is related to
fundamental stellar parameters. Finally, we present the first
amplitude-{$\nu$}$_{max}$ relation for Kepler red giants. We observe
a lack of low-amplitude stars for {$\nu$}$_{max}$ {\gt}\~{} 110 {$\mu$}Hz

  Abstract                 = {{The K2 Mission uses the Kepler spacecraft to obtain high-precision
photometry over \~{}80 day campaigns in the ecliptic plane. The Ecliptic
Plane Input Catalog (EPIC) provides coordinates, photometry and
kinematics based on a federation of all-sky catalogs to support target
selection and target management for the K2 mission. We describe the
construction of the EPIC, as well as modifications and shortcomings of
the catalog. Kepler magnitudes (Kp) are shown to be accurate to \~{}0.1 mag
for the Kepler field, and the EPIC is typically complete to Kp\~{}17 (Kp\~{}19
for campaigns covered by SDSS). We furthermore classify 138,600 targets
in Campaigns 1-8 (\~{}88\% of the full target sample) using colors, proper
motions, spectroscopy, parallaxes, and galactic population synthesis
models, with typical uncertainties for G-type stars of \~{}3\% in Teff, \~{}0.3
dex in log(g), \~{}40\% in radius, \~{}10\% in mass, and \~{}40\% in distance. Our
results show that stars targeted by K2 are dominated by K-M dwarfs (\~{}41\%
of all selected targets), F-G dwarfs (\~{}36\%) and K giants (\~{}21\%),
consistent with key K2 science programs to search for transiting
exoplanets and galactic archeology studies using oscillating red giants.
However, we find significant variation of the fraction of cool dwarfs
with galactic latitude, indicating a target selection bias due to
interstellar reddening. We discuss possible systematic errors in the
derived stellar properties, and differences to published classifications
for K2 exoplanet host stars. The EPIC is hosted at the Mikulski Archive
for Space Telescopes (MAST):

a Milky Way like barred spiral galaxy. We present a simple method that
samples N-body model particles into mock Gaia stellar observations and
takes into account stellar populations, dust extinction and Gaia's

spiral arm at a similar position to the Perseus arm at three lines of
sight in the disc plane; (l,b)=(90,0), (120,0) and (150,0) degrees. We
find that the structure of the peculiar kinematics around the
co-rotating spiral arm, which is found in Kawata et al. (2014b), is
still visible in the observational data expected to be produced by Gaia
despite the dust extinction and expected observational errors of Gaia.
These observable kinematic signatures will enable testing whether the
Perseus arm of the Milky Way is similar to the co-rotating spiral arms
commonly seen in N-body simulations.

  Abstract                 = {{Context.<ASTROBJ>NGC 6791</ASTROBJ> is a unique stellar system among
Galactic open clusters, which is at the same time one of the oldest open
clusters and the most metal rich. It is located inside the solar circle,
harbors a large population of binary stars, and possibly experienced
prolonged star formation. The combination of all these properties is
puzzling and poses the intriguing question of its origin. <BR /> Aims:
One possible scenario is that the cluster formed close to the Galactic
Center and later migrated outward to its current location. In this work
we study the cluster's orbit and investigate the possible migration
processes that may have displaced NGC 6791 to its present-day position,
under the assumption that it actually formed in the inner disk. <BR />
Methods: To this aim we performed integrations of NGC 6791's orbit in a
potential consistent with the main Milky Way parameters. In addition to
analytical expressions for halo, bulge and disk, we also consider the
effect of bar and spiral arm perturbations, which are expected to be
very important for the disk dynamical evolution, especially inside the
solar circle. Starting from state-of-the art initial conditions for NGC
6791, we calculated 1000 orbits back in time for about 1 Gyr turning
different non-axisymmetric components of the global potential on and
off. We then compared statistical estimates of the cluster's recent
orbital parameters with the orbital parameters of 10$^{4}$
test-particles originating close to the Galactic Center (with initial
galocentric radii in the range of 3-5 kpc) and undergoing radial
migration during 8 Gyr of forward integration. <BR /> Results: We find
that a model that incorporates a strong bar and spiral arm perturbations
can indeed be responsible for the migration of NGC 6791 from the inner
disk (galocentric radii of 3-5 kpc) to its present-day location. Such a
model can provide orbital parameters that are close enough to the
observed ones. However, the probability of this scenario as it results
from our investigations is very low.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. The nature of the metallicity gradient inside the solar circle
(R$_{GC}$ $\lt$ 8 kpc) is poorly understood, but studies of
Cepheids and a small sample of open clusters suggest that it steepens in
the inner disk. <BR /> Aims: We investigate the metallicity gradient of
the inner disk using a sample of inner disk open clusters that is three
times larger than has previously been studied in the literature to
better characterize the gradient in this part of the disk. <BR />
Methods: We used the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) [Fe/H] values and stellar
parameters for stars in 12 open clusters in the inner disk from GES-UVES
data. Cluster mean [Fe/H] values were determined based on a membership
analysis for each cluster. Where necessary, distances and ages to
clusters were determined via comparison to theoretical isochrones. <BR
/> Results: The GES open clusters exhibit a radial metallicity gradient
of -0.10 {\plusmn} 0.02 dex kpc$^{-1}$, consistent with the
gradient measured by other literature studies of field red giant stars
and open clusters in the range R$_{GC}$ \~{} 6-12 kpc. We also
measure a trend of increasing [Fe/H] with increasing cluster age, as has
also been found in the literature. <BR /> Conclusions: We find no
evidence for a steepening of the inner disk metallicity gradient inside
the solar circle as earlier studies indicated. The age-metallicity
relation shown by the clusters is consistent with that predicted by
chemical evolution models that include the effects of radial migration,
but a more detailed comparison between cluster observations and models
would be premature.

analyzed. The data are shown to be consistent with the suggestion that
there is a composition gradient among stars of all ages in the galactic
disk. Specifically, it is found that: (1) the metallicity gradient in
the solar vicinity is approximately -0.05/kpc; (2) the gradient may
become steeper beyond a galactocentric distance of approximately 11 kpc;
(3) the nitrogen gradient is more pronounced than the overall gradient;

dramatically different from the overall gradient

distances ranging over 5-125 kpc. These stars have been selected
photometrically and confirmed spectroscopically as K giants from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey{\rsquo}s Sloan Extension for Galactic
Understanding and Exploration project. Using a position-velocity
clustering estimator (the 4distance) and a model of a smooth stellar
halo, we quantify the amount of substructure in the halo, divided by
distance and metallicity. Overall, we find that the halo as a whole is
highly structured. We also confirm earlier work using blue horizontal
branch (BHB) stars which showed that there is an increasing amount of
substructure with increasing Galactocentric radius, and additionally
find that the amount of substructure in the halo increases with
increasing metallicity. Comparing to resampled BHB stars, we find that K
giants and BHBs have similar amounts of substructure over equivalent
ranges of Galactocentric radius. Using a friends-of-friends algorithm to
identify members of individual groups, we find that a large fraction
({\tilde}33\%) of grouped stars are associated with Sgr, and identify stars
belonging to other halo star streams: the Orphan Stream, the Cetus Polar
Stream, and others, including previously unknown substructures. A large
fraction of sample K giants (more than 50\%) are not grouped into any
substructure. We find also that the Sgr stream strongly dominates groups
in the outer halo for all except the most metal-poor stars, and suggest
that this is the source of the increase of substructure with
Galactocentric radius and metallicity.

low-resolution spectra of 130 043 F/G-type dwarf stars to study the

shows that the stars with poorer metallicity and larger vertical
distance from the Galactic plane tend to have a larger eccentricity and
velocity dispersion. After separating the sample stars into likely
thin-disc and thick-disc sub-samples, we find that there exists a
negative gradient of rotation velocity V$_{phi}$ with
metallicity [Fe/H] for the likely thin-disc sub-sample, and the
thick-disc sub-sample exhibits a larger positive gradient of rotation
velocity with metallicity. By comparing with model predictions, we
consider that the radial migration of stars appears to have influenced
the formation of the thin disc. In addition, our results show that the
observed thick-disc stellar orbital eccentricity distribution peaks at
low eccentricity (e {\tilde} 0.2) and extends to a high eccentricity (e
{\tilde} 0.8). We compare this result with four thick-disc formation
simulation models, which imply that our result is consistent with the
gas-rich merger model.

applying a clustering technique that is widely used in molecular biology
to construct an evolutionary tree from which three branches emerge.
These are interpreted as stellar populations that separate in age and
kinematics and can be thus attributed to the thin disc, the thick disc
and an intermediate population of probable distinct origin. We further
find six lone stars of intermediate age that could not be assigned to
any population with enough statistical significance. Combining the ages
of the stars with their position on the tree, we are able to quantify
the mean rate of chemical enrichment of each of the populations, and
thus show in a purely empirical way that the star formation rate in the
thick disc is much higher than that in the thin disc. We are also able
to estimate the relative contribution of dynamical processes such as
radial migration and disc heating to the distribution of chemical
elements in the solar neighbourhood. Our method offers an alternative
approach to chemical tagging methods with the advantage of visualizing
the behaviour of chemical elements in evolutionary trees. This offers a
new way to search for 'common ancestors' that can reveal the origin of
solar neighbourhood stars.

chemical abundances are of paramount importance. <BR /> Aims: We
determine elemental abundances of Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, and
Ni for our predefined set of Gaia FGK benchmark stars. <BR /> Methods:
By analysing high-resolution spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio
taken from several archive datasets, we combined results of eight
different methods to determine abundances on a line-by-line basis. We
performed a detailed homogeneous analysis of the systematic
uncertainties, such as differential versus absolute abundance analysis.
We also assessed errors that are due to non-local thermal equilibrium
and the stellar parameters in our final abundances. <BR /> Results: Our
results are provided by listing final abundances and the different
sources of uncertainties, as well as line-by-line and method-by-method
abundances. <BR /> Conclusions: The atmospheric parameters of the Gaia
FGK benchmark stars are already being widely used for calibration of
several pipelines that are applied to different surveys. With the added
reference abundances of ten elements, this set is very suitable for
calibrating the chemical abundances obtained by these pipelines.

in this matter as they are calibration pillars for the atmospheric

spectroscopic analyses of the benchmark stars are done by combining
different methods, and the results will be affected by the systematic
uncertainties inherent in each method. In this paper, we explore some of
these systematic uncertainties. We determined line abundances of Ca, Cr,
Mn and Co for four benchmark stars using six different methods. We
changed the default input parameters of the different codes in a
systematic way and found, in some cases, significant differences between
the results. Since there is no consensus on the correct values for many
of these default parameters, we urge the community to raise discussions
towards standard input parameters that could alleviate the difference in
abundances obtained by different methods. In this work, we provide
quantitative estimates of uncertainties in elemental abundances due to
the effect of differing technical assumptions in spectrum modelling.

  Abstract                 = {{Spectro-seismic measurements of red giants enabled the recent discovery
of stars in the thick disk that are more massive than 1.4
M$_{&sun;}$. While it has been claimed that most of these stars
are younger than the rest of the typical thick disk stars, we show
evidence that they might be products of mass transfer in binary
evolution, notably evolved blue stragglers. We took new measurements of
the radial velocities in a sample of 26 stars from APOKASC, including 13
''young'' stars and 13 ''old'' stars with similar stellar parameters but
with masses below 1.2 M$_{&sun;}$ and found that more of the young
starsappear to be in binary systems with respect to the old
stars.Furthermore, we show that the young stars do not follow the
expected trend of [C/H] ratios versus mass for individual stars.
However, with a population synthesis of low-mass stars including binary
evolution and mass transfer, we can reproduce the observed [C/N] ratios
versus mass. Our study shows how asteroseismology of solar-type red
giants provides us with a unique opportunity to study the evolution of
field blue stragglers after they have left the main-sequence.

Whilst the brightest nearby stars benefit from direct parallax

to measuring distances using spectroscopically identified twin stars.
Given a star with known parallax, the distance to its twin is assumed to
be directly related to the difference in their apparent magnitudes. We
found 175 twin pairs from the science public archive of the European
Southern Observatory (ESO) archives and report excellent agreement with
Hipparcos parallaxes within 7.5 per cent. Most importantly, the accuracy
of our results does not degrade with increasing stellar distance. With
the ongoing collection of high-resolution stellar spectra, our method is
well suited to complement Gaia.

the data from Gaia, one of the most ambitious ESA space missions, which
is to be launched in 2012. The purpose of this paper is to provide data
and tools to predict how Gaia photometry is expected to be. To do so, we
provide relationships among colours involving Gaia magnitudes (white
light G, blue G$_{BP}$, red G$_{RP}$ and G$_{RVS}$
bands) and colours from other commonly used photometric systems
(Johnson-Cousins, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Hipparcos and Tycho). <BR />
Methods: The most up-to-date information from industrial partners has
been used to define the nominal passbands, and based on the BaSeL3.1
stellar spectral energy distribution library, relationships were
obtained for stars with different reddening values, ranges of
temperatures, surface gravities and metallicities. <BR /> Results: The
transformations involving Gaia and Johnson-Cousins V - I$_{C}$ and
Sloan DSS g - z colours have the lowest residuals. A polynomial
expression for the relation between the effective temperature and the
colour G$_{BP}$ - G$_{RP}$ was derived for stars with
T$_{eff}$ {\ge} 4500 K. For stars with T$_{eff}$ $\lt$ 4500 K,
dispersions exist in gravity and metallicity for each absorption value
in g - r and r - i. Transformations involving two Johnson or two Sloan
DSS colours yield lower residuals than using only one colour. We also
computed several ratios of total-to-selective absorption including
absorption A$_{G}$ in the G band and colour excess
E(G$_{BP}$ - G$_{RP}$) for our sample stars. A relationship
involving A$_{G}$/A$_{V}$ and the intrinsic (V -
I$_{C}$) colour is provided. The derived Gaia passbands have been
used to compute tracks and isochrones using the Padova and BASTI models.
Finally, the performances of the predicted Gaia magnitudes have been
estimated according to the magnitude and the celestial coordinates of
the star. <BR /> Conclusions: The provided dependencies among colours
can be used for planning scientific exploitation of Gaia data,
performing simulations of the Gaia-like sky, planning ground-based
complementary observations and for building catalogues with auxiliary
data for the Gaia data processing and validation.

  Abstract                 = {{In the last few decades, many efforts have been made to understand the
effect of spiral arms on the gas and stellar dynamics in the Milky Way
disc. One of the fundamental parameters of the spiral structure is its
angular velocity, or pattern speed {$\Omega$}$_{p}$, which determines
the location of resonances in the disc and the spirals' radial extent.
The most direct method for estimating the pattern speed relies on
backward integration techniques, trying to locate the stellar birthplace
of open clusters. Here, we propose a new method based on the interaction
between the spiral arms and the stars in the disc. Using a sample of
around 500 open clusters from the New Catalogue of Optically Visible
Open Clusters and Candidates, and a sample of 500 giant stars observed
by Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment, we find
{$\Omega$}$_{p}$ = 23.0 {\plusmn} 0.5 km s$^{-1}$
kpc$^{-1}$, for a local standard of rest rotation V$_{0}$ =
220 km s$^{-1}$ and solar radius R$_{0}$ = 8.0 kpc.
Exploring a range in V$_{0}$ and R$_{0}$ within the
acceptable values, 200-240 km s$^{-1}$ and 7.5-8.5 kpc,
respectively, results only in a small change in our estimate of
{$\Omega$}$_{p}$, that is within the error. Our result is in close
agreement with a number of studies which suggest values in the range
20-25 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. An advantage of our method is
that we do not need knowledge of the stellar age, unlike in the case of
the birthplace method, which allows us to use data from large Galactic
surveys. The precision of our method will be improved once larger
samples of disc stars with spectroscopic information will become
available thanks to future surveys such as 4MOST.

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: We propose a new, more realistic description of the
perturbed gravitational potential of spiral galaxies, with spiral arms
having Gaussian-shaped groove profiles. The aim is to reach a
self-consistent description of the spiral structure, that is, one in
which an initial potential perturbation generates, by means of the
stellar orbits, spiral arms with a profile similar to that of the
imposed perturbation. Self-consistency is a condition for having
long-lived structures. <BR /> Methods: Using the new perturbed
potential, we investigate the stable stellar orbits in galactic disks
for galaxies with no bar or with only a weak bar. The model is applied
to our Galaxy by making use of the axisymmetric component of the
potential computed from the Galactic rotation curve, in addition to
other input parameters similar to those of our Galaxy. The influence of
the bulge mass on the stellar orbits in the inner regions of a disk is
also investigated. <BR /> Results: The new description offers the
advantage of easy control of the parameters of the Gaussian profile of
its potential. We compute the density contrast between arm and inter-arm
regions. We find a range of values for the perturbation amplitude from
400 to 800 km$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$ kpc$^{-1}$, which implies
an approximate maximum ratio of the tangential force to the axisymmetric
force between 3\% and 6\%. Good self-consistency of arm shapes is obtained
between the Inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) and the 4:1 resonance. Near
the 4:1 resonance the response density starts to deviate from the
imposed logarithmic spiral form. This creates bifurcations that appear
as short arms. Therefore the deviation from a perfect logarithmic spiral
in galaxies can be understood as a natural effect of the 4:1 resonance.
Beyond the 4:1 resonance we find closed orbits that have similarities
with the arms observed in our Galaxy. In regions near the center,
elongated stellar orbits appear naturally, in the presence of a massive
bulge, without imposing any bar-shaped potential, but only extending the
spiral perturbation a little inward of the ILR. This suggests that a bar
is formed with a half-size \~{}3 kpc by a mechanism similar to that of the
spiral arms. <BR /> Conclusions: The potential energy perturbation that
we adopted represents an important step in the direction of
self-consistency, compared to previous sine function descriptions of the
potential. In addition, our model produces a realistic description of
the spiral structure, which is able to explain several details that were
not yet understood.

observed in the age velocity dispersion relation (AVR). This effect
allows a determination of the star formation history SFR(t) from local
kinematical data of main sequence stars. Using a self-consistent disk
model for the vertical structure of the disk, we find from the
kinematics of the stars in the solar neighbourhood that the SFR shows a
moderate star burst about 10 Gyr ago followed by a continuous decline to
the present day value consistent with the observed number of OB stars.
The gravitational potential of the gas component and of the Dark Matter
Halo is included and the effect of chemical enrichment, finite lifetime
of the stars and mass loss of the stellar component are taken into
account. The scale heights for main sequence stars together with the SFR
is then used to determine constistently the IMF from the observed local
luminosity function. The main new result is that the power law break in
the present day mass function (PDMF) around 1 M $_{&sun;}$ is
entirely due to evolutionary effects of the disk and does not appear in
the IMF.

and the Fifth Catalogue of Nearby Stars. We have cross-matched to
sources in the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalogue so that for all stars
individually determined near-infrared (NIR) photometry is available on a
homogeneous system (typically K$_{s}$). The spatial completeness
of the sample has been carefully determined by statistical methods, and
the NIR LF of the stars has been derived by direct star counts. We find
a local volume luminosity of 0.121 {\plusmn} 0.004 L$_{K&sun;}$
pc$^{-3}$, corresponding to a volumetric mass-to-light ratio (M/L)
of M/L\_K = 0.31 {\plusmn} 0.02 $\{$M$\}$\_$\{${\sun}$\}$/L\_$\{$K{\sun}$\}$, where giants
contribute 80 per cent to the light but less than 2 per cent to the
stellar mass. We derive the surface brightness of the solar cylinder
with the help of a vertical disc model. We find a surface brightness of
99 L$_{K&sun;}$ pc$^{-2}$ with an uncertainty of
approximately 10 per cent. This corresponds to an M/L for the solar
cylinder of M/L\_K = 0.34 $\{$M$\}$\_$\{${\sun}$\}$/L\_$\{$K{\sun}$\}$. The M/L for the solar
cylinder is only 10 per cent larger than the local value despite the
fact that the local population has a much larger contribution of young
stars. It turns out that the effective scaleheights of the lower main
sequence carrying most of the mass is similar to that of the giants,
which are dominating the NIR light. The corresponding colour for the
solar cylinder is V - K = 2.89 mag compared to the local value of V - K
= 2.46 mag. An extrapolation of the local surface brightness to the
whole Milky Way yields a total luminosity of M$_{K}$ = -24.2 mag.
The Milky Way falls in the range of K band Tully-Fisher relations from
the literature.

characterized by a maximum at an age of 10 Gyr and a decline by a factor

  Abstract                 = {{We present a fully consistent evolutionary disc model of the solar
cylinder. The model is based on a sequence of stellar subpopulations
described by the star formation history (SFR) and the dynamical heating
law [given by the age-velocity dispersion relation (AVR)]. The stellar
subpopulations are in dynamical equilibrium and the gravitational
potential is calculated self-consistently including the influence of the
dark matter halo and the gas component. The combination of kinematic
data from Hipparcos and the finite lifetimes of main-sequence (MS) stars
enables us to determine the detailed vertical disc structure independent
of individual stellar ages and only weakly dependent on the initial mass
function (IMF). The disc parameters are determined by applying a
sophisticated best-fitting algorithm to the MS star velocity
distribution functions in magnitude bins. We find that the AVR is well
constrained by the local kinematics, whereas for the SFR the allowed
range is larger. The model is consistent with the local kinematics of MS
stars and fulfils the known constraints on scaleheights, surface
densities and mass ratios. A simple chemical enrichment model is
included in order to fit the local metallicity distribution of G dwarfs.
In our favoured Model A, the power-law index of the AVR is 0.375 with a
minimum and maximum velocity dispersion of 5.1 and 25.0km
s$^{-1}$, respectively. The SFR shows a maximum 10 Gyr ago and
declines by a factor of four to the present-day value of
1.5M$_{solar}$pc$^{-2}$Gyr$^{-1}$. A best fit of the
IMF leads to power-law indices of -1.46 below and -4.16 above
1.72M$_{solar}$ avoiding a kink at 1M$_{solar}$. An
isothermal thick-disc component with local density of \~{}6 per cent of the
stellar density is included. A thick disc containing more than 10 per
cent of local stellar mass is inconsistent with the local kinematics of
K and M dwarfs. Neglecting the thick-disc component results in slight
variations of the thin-disc properties, but has a negligible influence
on the AVR and the normalized SFR. The model allows detailed predictions
of the density, age, metallicity and velocity distribution functions of
MS stars as a function of height above the mid-plane. The complexity of
the model does not allow to rule out other star formation scenarios
using the local data alone. The incorporation of multiband star count
and kinematic data of larger samples in the near future will improve the
determination of the disc structure and evolution significantly.

a second telescope PS2 in approximately 18 months. A four aperture

mission. This will be able to scan the entire visible sky to
approximately 24$^{th}$ magnitude in less than a week, thereby

operation of the NASA Kepler satellite. This sample includes stars in a
wide mass and radius range with spectral types G and K, extending in
luminosity from the bottom of the giant branch up to high-luminous red
giants, including the red bump and clump. The high-precision
asteroseismic observations with Kepler provide a perfect source for
testing stellar structure and evolutionary models, as well as
investigating the stellar population in our Galaxy. <BR /> Aims: We aim
to extract accurate seismic parameters from the Kepler time series and
use them to infer asteroseismic fundamental parameters from scaling
relations and a comparison with red-giant models. <BR /> Methods: We fit
a global model to the observed power density spectra, which allows us to
accurately estimate the granulation background signal and the global
oscillation parameters, such as the frequency of maximum oscillation
power. We find regular patterns of radial and non-radial oscillation
modes and use a new technique to automatically identify the mode degree
and the characteristic frequency separations between consecutive modes
of the same spherical degree. In most cases, we can also measure the
small separation between l = 0, 1, and 2 modes. Subsequently, the
seismic parameters are used to estimate stellar masses and radii and to
place the stars in an H-R diagram by using an extensive grid of stellar
models that covers a wide parameter range. Using Bayesian techniques
throughout our entire analysis allows us to determine reliable
uncertainties for all parameters. <BR /> Results: We provide accurate
seismic parameters and their uncertainties for a large sample of red
giants and determine their asteroseismic fundamental parameters. We
investigate the influence of the stars' metallicities on their positions
in the H-R diagram. Finally, we study the red-giant populations in the
red clump and bump and compare them to a synthetic population. We find a
mass and metallicity gradient in the red clump and clear evidence of a
secondary-clump population.

  Abstract                 = {{We have developed a novel Markov Chain Mote Carlo (MCMC) chemical
``painting'' technique to explore possible radial and vertical metallicity
gradients for the thick disc progenitor. In our analysis we match an
N-body simulation to the data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. We assume that the thick disc has
a constant scale-height and has completed its formation at an early
epoch, after which time radial mixing of its stars has taken place.
Under these assumptions, we find that the initial radial metallicity
gradient of the thick disc progenitor should not be negative, but either
flat or even positive, to explain the current negative vertical
metallicity gradient of the thick disc. Our study suggests that the
thick disc was built-up in an inside-out and upside-down fashion, and
older, smaller and thicker populations are more metal poor. In this
case, star forming discs at different epochs of the thick disc formation
are allowed to have different radial metallicity gradients, including a
negative one, which helps to explain a variety of slopes observed in
high redshift disc galaxies. This scenario helps to explain the positive
slope of the metallicity-rotation velocity relation observed for the
Galactic thick disc. On the other hand, radial mixing flattens the slope
of an existing gradient.

Spectroscopic Surveys, Asteroseismology and Chemodynamical Models. The
discussion focused on the following question: ''Are there distinct thick
and thin disks?''. The answer to this question depends on the definition
one adopts for thin and thick disks. The participants of this discussion
converged to the idea that there are at least two different types of
disks in the Milky Way. However, there are still important open
questions on how to best define these two types of disks (chemically,
kinematically, geometrically or by age?). The question of what is the
origin of the distinct disks remains open. The future Galactic surveys
which are highlighted in this conference should help us answering these
questions. The almost one-hour debate involving researchers in the field
representing different modelling approaches (Galactic models such as
TRILEGAL, Besan{\c c}on and Galaxia, chemical evolution models,
extended distribution functions method, chemodynamics in the
cosmological context, and self-consistent cosmological simulations)
illustrated how important is to have all these parallel approaches. All
approaches have their advantages and shortcomings (also discussed), and
different approaches are useful to address specific points that might
help us answering the more general question above.

metallicities (abundances of elements heavier than helium) indicate that
the gas out of which the stars formed was enriched in each case by at
most a few--and potentially only one--low-energy supernova. Such
supernovae yield large quantities of light elements such as carbon but
very little iron. The dominance of low-energy supernovae seems
surprising, because it had been expected that the first stars were
extremely massive, and that they disintegrated in pair-instability
explosions that would rapidly enrich galaxies in iron. What has remained
unclear is the yield of iron from the first supernovae, because hitherto
no star has been unambiguously interpreted as encapsulating the yield of
a single supernova. Here we report the optical spectrum of SMSS
J031300.36-670839.3, which shows no evidence of iron (with an upper
limit of 10$^{-7.1}$ times solar abundance). Based on a comparison
of its abundance pattern with those of models, we conclude that the star
was seeded with material from a single supernova with an original mass
about 60 times that of the Sun (and that the supernova left behind a
black hole). Taken together with the four previously mentioned
low-metallicity stars, we conclude that low-energy supernovae were
common in the early Universe, and that such supernovae yielded
light-element enrichment with insignificant iron. Reduced stellar
feedback both chemically and mechanically from low-energy supernovae
would have enabled first-generation stars to form over an extended
period. We speculate that such stars may perhaps have had an important
role in the epoch of cosmic reionization and the chemical evolution of
early galaxies.

population, for half of the open clusters in the Milky Way reported in

approximate size. <BR /> Aims: The main goal of this study is to
determine a full set of uniform spatial, structural, kinematic, and
astrophysical parameters for as many known open clusters as possible.
<BR /> Methods: On the basis of stellar data from PPMXL and 2MASS, we
used a dedicated data-processing pipeline to determine kinematic and
photometric membership probabilities for stars in a cluster region. <BR
/> Results: For an input list of 3784 targets from the literature, we
confirm that 3006 are real objects, the vast majority of them are open
clusters, but associations and globular clusters are also present. For
each confirmed object we determined the exact position of the cluster
centre, the apparent size, proper motion, distance, colour excess, and
age. For about 1500 clusters, these basic astrophysical parameters have
been determined for the first time. For the bulk of the clusters we also
derived the tidal radius. We estimated additionally average radial
velocities for more than 30\% of the confirmed clusters. The present
sample (called MWSC) reaches both the central parts of the Milky Way and
its outer regions. It is almost complete up to 1.8 kpc from the Sun and
also covers neighbouring spiral arms. However, for a small subset of the
oldest open clusters (log t {\gsim} 9) we found some evidence of
incompleteness within about 1 kpc from the Sun.

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: On the basis of the PPMXL star catalogue we performed a
survey of star clusters in the second quadrant of the Milky Way. <BR />
Methods: From the PPMXL catalogue of positions and proper motions we
took the subset of stars with near-infrared photometry from 2MASS and
added the remaining 2MASS stars without proper motions (called 2MAst,
i.e. 2MASS with astrometry). We developed a data-processing pipeline
including interactive human control of a standardised set of
multi-dimensional diagrams to determine kinematic and photometric
membership probabilities for stars in a cluster region. The pipeline
simultaneously produced the astrophysical parameters of a cluster. From
literature we compiled a target list of presently known open and
globular clusters, cluster candidates, associations, and moving groups.
From established member stars we derived spatial parameters (coordinates
of centres and radii of the main morphological parts of clusters) and
cluster kinematics (average proper motions and sometimes radial
velocities). For distance, reddening, and age determination we used
specific sets of theoretical isochrones. Tidal parameters were obtained
by a fit of three-parameter King profiles to the observed density
distributions of members. <BR /> Results: We investigated all 871
objects in the 2nd Galactic quadrant, of which we successfully treated
642 open clusters, 2 globular clusters, and 8 stellar associations. The
remaining 219 objects (24\%) were recognised by us to be nonexistent
clusters, duplicate entries, or clusters too faint for 2MAst. We found
that our sample is complete in the 2nd quadrant up to a distance of 2
kpc, where the average surface density is 94 clusters per
kpc$^{2}$. Compared with literature values we found good agreement
in spatial and kinematic data, as well as for optical distances and
reddening. Small, but systematic offsets were detected in the age
determination.

  Abstract                 = {{We present new limits on the ejection of metal-rich old-population
hypervelocity stars (HVSs) from the Galactic center (GC) as probed by
the SEGUE-2 survey. Our limits are a factor of 3-10 more stringent than
previously reported, depending on stellar type. Compared to the known
population of B-star ejectees, there can be no more than 30 times more
metal-rich old-population F/G stars ejected from the GC. Because B stars
comprise a tiny fraction of a normal stellar population, this places
significant limits on the combination of the GC mass function and the
ejection mechanism for HVSs. In the presence of a normal GC mass
function, our results require an ejection mechanism that is about 5.5
times more efficient at ejecting B stars compared to low-mass F/G stars.

in particular in the solar neighbourhood. We find that RAVE is rich in
supersolar metallicity stars, and that the local metallicity
distribution function declines remarkably slowly up to +0.4 dex. Our
results show that the kinematics and height distributions of the
supersolar metallicity stars are identical to those of the [M/H] {\lsim}
0 thin-disc giants that we presume were locally manufactured. The
eccentricities of the supersolar metallicity stars indicate that half of
them are on a roughly circular orbit (e {\le} 0.15), so under the
assumption that the metallicity of the interstellar medium at a given
radius never decreases with time, they must have increased their angular
momenta by scattering at corotation resonances of spiral arms from
regions far inside the solar annulus. The likelihood that a star will
migrate radially does not seem to decrease significantly with increasing
amplitude of vertical oscillations within range of oscillation
amplitudes encountered in the disc.

(RAVE-DR4) survey the stars located between 1 and 2 kpc above the
Galactic plane, we question the consistency of the simplest
three-component model (thin disc, thick disc and halo) for the Milky
Way. We confirm that the metallicity and azimuthal velocity distribution
functions of the thick disc are not Gaussian. In particular, we find
that the thick disc has an extended metallicity tail going at least down
to [M/H] = {\dash}2 dex, contributing roughly 3 per cent of the entire
thick disc population and having a shorter scalelength compared to the
canonical thick disc. The mean azimuthal velocity of these metal-poor
stars allows us to estimate the correlation between the metallicity
([M/H]) and the orbital velocity (V$_{phi}$), which is an
important constraint on the formation mechanisms of the Galactic thick
disc. Given our simple approach, we find
{\part}V$_{phi}$/{\part}[M/H]{\ap} 50 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$, which is in very good agreement with previous
literature values. We complete the study with a brief discussion on the
implications of the formation scenarios for the thick disc and suggest
that given the above-mentioned characteristics, a thick disc mainly
formed by radial migration mechanisms seems unlikely.

  Abstract                 = {{Correlations between stellar chemistry and kinematics have long been
used to gain insight into the evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy. Orbital
angular momentum is a key physical parameter and it is often estimated
from three-dimensional space motions. We here demonstrate the lower
uncertainties that can be achieved in the estimation of one component of
velocity through selection of stars in key directions and use of
line-of-sight velocity alone (i.e. without incorporation of proper
motion data). In this first paper we apply our technique to stars
observed in the direction of Galactic rotation in the APOGEE survey. We
first derive the distribution of azimuthal velocities, $v\_\phi$, then
from these and observed radial coordinates, estimate the stellar guiding
centre radii, $R\_g$, within $6.9\leq R \leq 10$ kpc with uncertainties
smaller than (or of the order of) 1kpc. We show that there is no simple
way to select a clean stellar sample based on low errors on proper
motions and distances to obtain high-quality 3D velocities and hence one
should pay particular attention when trying to identify kinematically
peculiar stars based on velocities derived using the proper motions.
Using our azimuthal velocity estimations, we investigate the joint
distribution of elemental abundances and rotational kinematics free from
the blurring effects of epicyclic motions, and we derive the $\partial
v\_\phi / \partial R\_g$ trends for the thin and thick discs as a function
of radius. Our analysis provides further evidence for radial migration
within the thin disc and against radial migration playing a significant
role in the evolution of the thick disc.

  Abstract                 = {{The technique of chemical tagging uses the elemental abundances of
stellar atmospheres to 'reconstruct' chemically homogeneous star
clusters that have long since dispersed. The GALAH spectroscopic survey
- which aims to observe one million stars using the Anglo-Australian
Telescope - allows us to measure up to 30 elements or dimensions in the
stellar chemical abundance space, many of which are not independent. How
to find clustering reliably in a noisy high-dimensional space is a
difficult problem that remains largely unsolved. Here, we explore
t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) - which identifies
an optimal mapping of a high-dimensional space into fewer dimensions -
whilst conserving the original clustering information. Typically, the
projection is made to a 2D space to aid recognition of clusters by eye.
We show that this method is a reliable tool for chemical tagging because
it can: (i) resolve clustering in chemical space alone, (ii) recover
known open and globular clusters with high efficiency and low
contamination, and (iii) relate field stars to known clusters. t-SNE
also provides a useful visualization of a high-dimensional space. We
demonstrate the method on a data set of 13 abundances measured in the
spectra of 187 000 stars by the GALAH survey. We recover seven of the
nine observed clusters (six globular and three open clusters) in
chemical space with minimal contamination from field stars and low
numbers of outliers. With chemical tagging, we also identify two
Pleiades supercluster members (which we confirm kinematically), one as
far as 6{\deg} - one tidal radius away from the cluster centre.

impact of that process on the local properties of the disk
(age-metallicity relation and its dispersion, metallicity distribution,
evolution of abundance ratios) and on the morphological properties of
the resulting thick and thin disks. <BR /> Methods: We use a model with
several new or up-dated ingredients: atomic and molecular gas phases,
star formation that depends on molecular gas, yields from a recent
homogeneous grid and observationally inferred SNIa rates. We describe
radial migration with parametrised time- and radius-dependent diffusion
coefficients, based on the analysis of an N-body+SPH simulation. We also
consider parametrised radial gas flows, induced by the action of the
Galactic bar. <BR /> Results: Our model reproduces current values of
most of the main global observables of the MW disk and bulge, and also
the observed ''stacked'' evolution of MW-type galaxies. The azimuthally
averaged radial velocity of gas inflow is constrained to less than a few
tenths of km s$^{-1}$. Radial migration is constrained by the
observed dispersion in the age-metallicity relation. Assuming that the
thick disk is the oldest ($\gt$9 Gyr) part of the disk, we find that the
adopted radial migration scheme can quantitatively reproduce the main
local properties of the thin and thick disk: metallicity distributions,
''two-branch'' behaviour in the O/Fe vs. Fe/H relation and the local
surface densities of stars. The thick disk extends up to \~{}11 kpc and has
a scale length of 1.8 kpc, which is considerably shorter than the thin
disk, because of the inside-out formation scheme. We also show how, in
this framework, current and forthcoming spectroscopic observations can
constrain the nucleosynthesis yields of massive stars for the
metallicity range of 0.1 Z$_{&sun;}$ to 2-3 Z$_{&sun;}$.

flattening both in the inner disk (because of radial flows) and in the
outer disk (because of the adopted star formation law). The gas
abundance profiles flatten with time, but the corresponding stellar
profiles appear to be steeper for younger stars, because of radial
migration. We find a correlation between the stellar abundance profiles
and O/Fe, which is a proxy for stellar age. Our final abundance profiles
are in overall agreement with observations, but slightly steeper (by
0.01-0.02 dex kpc$^{-1}$) for elements above S. We find an
interesting ''odd-even effect'' in the behaviour of the abundance profiles
(steeper slopes for odd elements) for all sets of stellar yields;
however, this behaviour does not appear in observations, suggesting that
the effect is, perhaps, overestimated in current stellar nucleosynthesis
calculations.

galaxy, by analysing the results of a fully self-consistent,
high-resolution N-body+smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation.
We find different behaviours for gas and star particles. Gas within
corotation is driven in the central regions by the bar, where it forms a
pseudo-bulge (discy-bulge), but it undergoes negligible radial
displacement outside the bar region. Stars undergo substantial radial
migration at all times, caused first by transient spiral arms and later
by the bar. Despite the important amount of radial migration occurring
in our model, its impact on the chemical properties is limited. The
reason is the relatively flat abundance profile, due to the rapid early
evolution of the whole disc. We show that the implications of radial
migration on chemical evolution can be studied to a good accuracy by
post-processing the results of the N-body+SPH calculation with a simple
chemical evolution model having detailed chemistry and a parametrized
description of radial migration. We find that radial migration impacts
on chemical evolution both directly (by moving around the long-lived
agents of nucleosynthesis, like e.g. SNIa or asymptotic giant branch
stars, and thus altering the abundance profiles of the gas) and
indirectly (by moving around the long-lived tracers of chemical
evolution and thus affecting stellar metallicity profiles, local
age-metallicity relations and metallicity distributions of stars, etc.).

that the brightest clusters in the Galaxy might actually be the remnant
nuclei of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. If the present Galactic globular
clusters formed within larger stellar systems, they are likely to be
surrounded by extratidal halos and/or tails made up of stars that were
tidally stripped from their parent systems. <BR /> Aims: The stellar
surroundings around globular clusters are therefore one of the best
places to look for the remnants of an ancient dwarf galaxy. Here an
attempt is made to search for tidal debris around the supernovae
enriched globular clusters M 22 and NGC 1851, as well as the
kinematically unique cluster NGC 3201. <BR /> Methods: The stellar
parameters from the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) are used to
identify stars with the RAVE metallicities, radial velocities, and
elemental abundances that are consistent with the abundance patterns and
properties of the stars in M 22, NGC 1851, and NGC 3201. <BR /> Results:
Discovery of RAVE stars that may be associated with M 22 and NGC 1851
are reported, some of which are at projected distances \~{}10 degrees away
from the core of these clusters. Numerous RAVE stars associated with NGC
3201 suggest that either the tidal radius of this cluster is
underestimated or that there are some unbound stars extending a few arc
minutes from the edge of the cluster's radius. No other extratidal stars
associated with NGC 3201 could be identified. The bright magnitudes of
the RAVE stars make them easy targets for high-resolution follow-up
observations, eventually allowing further chemical tagging to solidify
(or exclude) stars outside the tidal radius of the cluster as tidal
debris. In both our radial velocity histograms of the regions
surrounding NGC 1851 and NGC 3201, a peak of stars at \~{}230 km
s$^{-1}$ is seen, consistent with extended tidal debris from
{$\omega$} Centauri.

strength of the TiO{$\epsilon$} molecular band as a first step toward a
metallicity ranking of the stellar sample, from which we confirm the

fifth data release from a magnitude-limited (9$\lt$ I$\lt$ 12) survey of

medium-resolution spectra (R{\sim} 7500) covering the Ca-triplet region
(8410{\ndash}8795 {\AA}) span the complete time frame from the start of
RAVE observations in 2003 to their completion in 2013. Radial velocities
from 520,781 spectra of 457,588 unique stars are presented, of which
255,922 stellar observations have parallaxes and proper motions from the
Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution in Gaia DR1. For our main DR5 catalog,
stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and overall
metallicity) are computed using the RAVE DR4 stellar pipeline, but
calibrated using recent K2 Campaign 1 seismic gravities and Gaia
benchmark stars, as well as results obtained from high-resolution
studies. Also included are temperatures from the Infrared Flux Method,
and we provide a catalog of red giant stars in the dereddened color
$\{$(J-$\{$Ks$\}$)$\}$$_{0}$ interval (0.50, 0.85) for which the gravities
were calibrated based only on seismology. Further data products for
subsamples of the RAVE stars include individual abundances for Mg, Al,
Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ni, and distances found using isochrones. Each RAVE
spectrum is complemented by an error spectrum, which has been used to
determine uncertainties on the parameters. The data can be accessed via
the RAVE Web site or the VizieR database.

  Abstract                 = {{In order to understand the Barium abundance distribution in the Galactic
disk based on Cepheids, one must first be aware of important effects of
the corotation resonance, situated a little beyond the solar orbit. The
thin disk of the Galaxy is divided in two regions that are separated by
a barrier situated at that radius. Since the gas cannot get across that
barrier, the chemical evolution is independent on the two sides of it.
The barrier is caused by the opposite directions of flows of gas, on the
two sides, in addition to a Cassini-like ring void of HI (caused itself
by the flows). A step in the metallicity gradient developed at
corotation, due to the difference in the average star formation rate on
the two sides, and to this lack of communication between them. In
connection with this, a proof that the spiral arms of our Galaxy are
long-lived (a few billion years) is the existence of this step. When one
studies the abundance gradients by means of stars which span a range of
ages, like the Cepheids, one has to take into account that stars,
contrary to the gas, have the possibility of crossing the corotation
barrier. A few stars born on the high metallicity side are seen on the
low metallicity one, and vice-versa. In the present work we re-discuss
the data on Barium abundance in Cepheids as a function of Galactic
radius, taking into account the scenario described above. The [Ba/H]
ratio, plotted as a function of Galactic radius, apparently presents a
distribution with two branches in the external region (beyond
corotation). One can re-interpret the data and attribute the upper
branch to the stars that were born on the high metallicity side. The
lower branch, analyzed separately, indicates that the stars born beyond
corotation have a rising Barium metallicity as a function of Galactic
radius.

Galactic disc, best revealed by Open Clusters and Cepheids, and the
spiral structure, has been explored. The step-like abrupt decrease in
metallicity at 8.5 kpc (with R$_{0}$= 7.5 kpc, or at 9.5 kpc if
R$_{0}$= 8.5 kpc is adopted) is well explained by the corotation
ring-shaped gap in the density of gas, which isolates the internal and
external regions of the disc one from the other. This solves the
long-standing problem of a lack of understanding of the different
chemical characteristics of the inner and outer parts of the disc. The
time required to build up the metallicity difference between the two
sides of the step is a measure of the minimal lifetime of the present
grand-design spiral pattern structure, of the order of 3 Gyr. The
plateaux observed on both sides of the step are interpreted in terms of
the large-scale radial motion of the stars and of the gas flow induced
by the spiral structure. The star formation rate revealed by the density
of open clusters is maximum in the Galactic radial range from 6 to 12
kpc (with an exception of a narrow gap at corotation), coinciding with
the region where the four-arms mode is allowed to exist. We argue that
most of the old open clusters situated at large Galactocentric radii
were born in this inner region where conditions more favourable for star
formation are found. The ratio of {$\alpha$}-elements to Fe of the sample
of Cepheids does not vary appreciably with the Galactic radius, which
reveals a homogeneous history of star formation. Different arguments are
forwarded to show that the usual approximations of chemical evolution
models, which assume fast mixing of metallicity in the azimuthal
direction and ignore the existence of the spiral arms, are poor ones.

  Abstract                 = {{We have pursued two different methods to analyze the old stellar
population near the Galactic plane, using data from the 2MASS survey.
The first method is based on the isolation of the red clump giant
population in the color-magnitude diagrams and the inversion of its star
counts to obtain directly the density distribution along the line of
sight. The second method fits the parameters of a disc model to the star
counts in 820 regions. Results from both independent methods are
consistent with each other. The qualitative conclusions are that the
disc is well fitted by an exponential distribution in both the
galactocentric distance and height. There is not an abrupt cut-off in
the stellar disc (at least within R$\lt$15 kpc). There is a strong flare
(i.e. an increase of scale-height towards the outer Galaxy) which begins
well inside the solar circle, and hence there is a decrease of the
scale-height towards the inner Galaxy. Another notable feature is the
existence of a warp in the old stellar population whose amplitude is
coincident with the amplitude of the gas warp. It is shown for low
latitude stars (mean height: |z| \~{} 300 pc) in the outer disc
(galactocentric radius R$\gt$ 6 kpc) that: the scale-height in the solar
circle is h$_{z}$(R$_{sun}$)=3.6x 10$^{-2}$
R$_{sun}$, the scale-length of the surface density is
h$_{R}$=0.42 R$_{sun}$ and the scale-length of the space
density in the plane (i.e. including the effect of the flare) is H=0.25
R$_{sun}$. The variation of the scale-height due to the flare
follows roughly a law h$_{z}$(R)\~{} h$_{z}$(R$_{sun}$)
exp (R-R$_{sun}$)/([12-0.6R(kpc)] kpc) (for R$\lt$\~{} 15 kpc;
R$_{sun}$=7.9 kpc). The warp moves the mean position of the disc
to a height z$_{w}$=1.2x 10$^{-3}$ R(kpc)$^{5.25}$sin
(phi +5$^{o}$ ) pc (for R$\lt$\~{} 13 kpc; R$_{sun}$=7.9 kpc).

concerning the existence in our Galaxy of a long, flat bar with
approximate dimensions of 7.8 kpc{\times}1.2 kpc{\times}0.2 kpc and a
position angle of approximately 43{\deg}: (1) star counts with 2MASS

excess in the plane region along
0$^{deg}$$\lt$l$\lt$30$^{deg}$ compared with
-30$^{deg}$$\lt$l$\lt$0$^{deg}$ that cannot be due to the
bulge, spiral arms, a ring, or extinction; and (2) new data on the
distance of the long bar using the red clump method, together with
recent observations of our own that are compared with our model and that
are in agreement with the long-bar scenario.

intrinsic ellipticity which breaks the exact axisymmetry and there may
also be some migration of stars inwards or outwards. Both phenomena can
be detected through kinematic analyses. We use the red clump stars
selected spectroscopically from the APO Galactic Evolution Experiment,
with known distances and radial velocities, to measure the radial
component of the Galactocentric velocities within 5 kpc $\lt$ R $\lt$ 16
kpc, | b| $\backslash$lt 5\^{}$\backslash$circ , and within 20{\deg} from the Sun-Galactic

= (1.48 {\plusmn} 0.35)[R(kpc) - (8.8 {\plusmn} 2.7)] km
s$^{-1}$ outwards in the explored range, with a higher
contribution from stars below the Galactic plane. Two possible
explanations can be given for this result: (i) the mean orbit of the
disk stars is intrinsically elliptical with a Galactocentric radial
gradient of eccentricity around 0.01 kpc$^{-1}$ or (ii)
there is a net secular expansion of the disk, in which stars within R
{\ap} 9-11 kpc are migrating to the region R {\gsim} 11 kpc at the
rate of {\tilde}2 M$_{&sun;}$ yr$^{-1}$, and stars with R
{\lsim} 9 kpc are falling toward the center of the Galaxy. This migration
ratio would be unattainable for a long time and should decelerate,
otherwise the Galaxy would fade away in around 1 Gyr. At present, both
hypotheses are speculative and one would need data on the Galactocentric
radial velocities for other azimuths different to the center or
anticenter in order to confirm one of the scenarios.

bulge), as well as for the existence of the ring and the truncation of

and Two Micron Galactic Survey star counts for the characteristic
signatures of an in-plane bar and ring. The star counts in the plane for
30$^{o}$$\gt$l$\gt$-30$^{o}$ are shown to be highly asymmetric
with considerably more sources at positive than at negative longitudes.
At |b|\~{} 1.5$^{o}$, however, the counts are nearly symmetric.
Therefore, the asymmetry is not due to the disc, which is shown to have
an inner truncation, or to the bulge, so there has to be another major
component in the inner Galaxy that is causing the asymmetries. This
component provides up to 50\% of the detected sources in the plane
between the bulge and l=27$^{o}$ or l=-14$^{o}$. This
component is shown to be consistent with an in-plane bar with a position
angle of 40$^{o}$ and half-length of 3.9 kpc. However, there is
also a major peak in the counts at l=-22$^{o}$, which coincides
with the tangential point of the so-called 3 kpc arm. This is shown to
be most probably a ring or a pseudo-ring. The extinction in the plane is
also shown to be asymmetric with more extinction at negative than at
positive longitudes. For l$\lt$8$^{o}$ the extinction is shown to
be slightly tilted with respect to b=0$^{o}$ in the same manner as
the HI disc. We conclude that the Galaxy is a fairly typical ringed
barred spiral galaxy.

southern galactic latitudes in the region of CMa. <BR />Methods: We
perform a critical re-analysis and discussion of recent results
presented in the literature which interpret the CMa overdensity as the
signature of an accreting dwarf galaxy or a new substructure within the
Galaxy. Several issues are addressed. <BR />Results: We show that
arguments against the {\ldquo}warp{\rdquo} interpretation are based on an
erroneous perception of the Milky Way. There is nothing anomalous with
colour-magnitude diagrams on opposite sides of the average warp
mid-plane being different. We witnessed the rise and fall of the blue
plume population, first attributed to young stars in a disrupting dwarf
galaxy and now discarded as a normal disc population. Similarly, there
is nothing anomalous in the outer thin+thick disc metallicities being
low (-1 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.5), and spiral arms (as part of the thin
disc) should, and do, warp. Most importantly, we show unambiguously
that, contrary to previous claims, the warp produces a stellar
overdensity that is distance-compatible with that observed in CMa. <BR
/>Conclusions: The CMa over-density remains fully accounted for in a
first order approach by Galactic models without new substructures. Given
the intrinsic uncertainties (concerning the properties of the warp,
flare and disc cutoff, the role of extinction and degeneracy), minor
deviations with respect to these models are not enough to support the
hypothesis of an accreted dwarf galaxy or new substructure within the
Milky Way disc.

close to that of the Sun and the solar system, and only slightly higher
than the primordial $^{3}$He abundance as predicted by the
standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. However, the classical theory of
stellar evolution predicts a high production of $^{3}$He by
low-mass stars, implying a strong increase of $^{3}$He with time
in the Galaxy. This is the well-known ''$^{3}$He problem''. <BR />
Aims: We study the effects of thermohaline and rotation-induced mixings
on the production and destruction of $^{3}$He over the lifetime of
low- and intermediate-mass stars at various metallicities. <BR />
Methods: We compute stellar evolutionary models in the mass range 1 to 6
M$_{&sun;}$ for four metallicities, taking into account
thermohaline instability and rotation-induced mixing. For the
thermohaline diffusivity we use the prescription based on the linear
stability analysis, which reproduces red giant branch (RGB) abundance
patterns at all metallicities. Rotation-induced mixing is treated taking
into account meridional circulation and shear turbulence. We discuss the
effects of these processes on internal and surface abundances of
$^{3}$He and on the net yields. <BR /> Results: Over the whole
mass and metallicity range investigated, rotation-induced mixing lowers
the $^{3}$He production, as well as the upper mass limit at which
stars destroy $^{3}$He. For low-mass stars, thermohaline mixing
occuring beyond the RGB bump is the dominant process in strongly
reducing the net $^{3}$He yield compared to standard computations.
Yet these stars remain net $^{3}$He producers. <BR /> Conclusions:
Overall, the net $^{3}$He yields are strongly reduced compared to
the standard framework predictions.

Thermohaline mixing whose effects can be identified using spectroscopic

significant. Although the seismic distances for the cluster members are
self consistent they are somewhat larger than the Hipparcos distance.
This is an issue that should be considered elsewhere. Models including
thermohaline instability and rotation-induced mixing, together with the
seismically determined masses can explain the chemical properties of
red-giants targets. However, with this sample of stars we cannot perform
stringent tests of the current stellar models. Tighter constraints on
the physics of the models would require the measurement of the core and
surface rotation rates, and of the period spacing of gravity-dominated
mixed modes. A larger number of stars with longer times series, as
provided by Kepler or expected with Plato, would help for ensemble
asteroseismology.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. The cornerstone mission of the European Space Agency, Gaia,
together with forthcoming complementary surveys (CoRoT, Kepler, K2,
APOGEE, and Gaia-ESO), will revolutionize our understanding of the
formation and history of our Galaxy, providing accurate stellar masses,
radii, ages, distances, as well as chemical properties for a very large
sample of stars across different Galactic stellar populations. <BR />
Aims: Using an improved population synthesis approach and new stellar
evolution models we attempt to evaluate the possibility of deriving ages
and masses of clump stars from their chemical properties. <BR />
Methods: A new version of the Besan{\c c}on Galaxy models (BGM) is
used in which new stellar evolutionary tracks are computed from the
stellar evolution code STAREVOL. These provide global, chemical, and
seismic properties of stars from the pre-main sequence to the early-AGB.
For the first time, the BGM can explore the effects of an extra-mixing
occurring in red-giant stars. In particular we focus on the effects of
thermohaline instability on chemical properties as well as on the
determination of stellar ages and masses using the surface [C/N]
abundance ratio. <BR /> Results: The impact of extra-mixing on
$^{3}$He, $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C, nitrogen, and [C/N]
abundances along the giant branch is quantified. We underline the
crucial contribution of asteroseismology to discriminate between
evolutionary states of field giants belonging to the Galactic disc. The
inclusion of thermohaline instability has a significant impact on
$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C, $^{3}$He as well as on the [C/N]
values. We clearly show the efficiency of thermohaline mixing at
different metallicities and its influence on the determined stellar mass
and age from the observed [C/N] ratio. We then propose simple relations
to determine ages and masses from chemical abundances according to these
models. <BR /> Conclusions: We emphasize the usefulness of population
synthesis tools to test stellar models and transport processes inside
stars. We show that transport processes occurring in red-giant stars
should be taken into account in the determination of ages for future
Galactic archaeology studies.

astronomy including galaxy and star cluster evolution, nucleosynthesis

massive star evolution is very diverse, being sensitive to metallicity,
binarity, rotation, and possibly magnetic fields. Although the problem
to obtain a good statistical observational database is alleviated by
current large spectroscopic surveys, it remains a challenge to model
these diverse paths of massive stars toward their violent end stage. I
show that the main sequence stage offers the best opportunity to gauge
the relevance of the various possible evolutionary scenarios. This also
allows sketching the post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars, for
which observations of Wolf-Rayet stars give essential clues. Recent
supernova discoveries owing to the current boost in transient searches
allow tentative mappings of progenitor models with supernova types,
including pair-instability supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.

diagram for stellar structure and evolution, which has now been in use
for more than 100 years. <BR /> Aims: We introduce a new diagram based
on the gravity-effective temperature diagram, which has various
advantages. <BR /> Methods: Our spectroscopic Hertzsprung-Russell (sHR)
diagram shows the inverse of the flux-mean gravity versus the effective
temperature. Observed stars whose spectra have been quantitatively
analyzed can be entered in this diagram without the knowledge of the
stellar distance or absolute brightness. <BR /> Results: Observed stars
can be as conveniently compared to stellar evolution calculations in the
sHR diagram as in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. However, at the same
time, our ordinate is proportional to the stellar mass-to-luminosity
ratio, which can thus be directly determined. For intermediate- and
low-mass star evolution at constant mass, we show that the shape of an
evolutionary track in the sHR diagram is identical to that in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We also demonstrate that for hot stars,
their stellar Eddington factor can be directly read off the sHR diagram.
For stars near their Eddington limit, we argue that a version of the sHR
diagram may be useful where the gravity is exchanged by the effective
gravity. <BR /> Conclusions: We discuss the advantages and limitations
of the sHR diagram, and show that it can be fruitfully applied to
Galactic stars, but also to stars with known distance, e.g., in the LMC
or in galaxies beyond the Local Group.

metallicity (Z$_{&sun;}$/5 and Z$_{&sun;}$/20), and analyze
their mass loss rates. <BR />Results: We find that the bifurcation
between quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution for fast rotation and
conventional evolution for slower rotation, which has been found earlier
for massive low metallicity stars, persists in the mass range considered
here. Consequently, there are two separate PCSN progenitor types: (I)
fast rotators produce PCSNe from very massive Wolf-Rayet stars, and (II)
slower rotators that generate PCSNe in hydrogen-rich massive yellow
hypergiants. <BR />Conclusions: We find that hydrogen-rich PCSNe could
occur at metallicities as high as Z$_{&sun;}$/3, which - assuming
standard IMFs are still valid to estimate their birth rates - results in
a rate of about one PCSN per 1000 supernovae in the local universe, and
one PCSN per 100 supernovae at a redshift of z = 5. PCSNe from WC-type
Wolf-Rayet stars are restricted to much lower metallicity.

developed and optimized to measure accurate metallicities from atomic
lines in the J-band of single red supergiant (RSG) or RSG-dominated star
clusters. Hence, our metallicity measurements are not affected by the
biases and poorly understood systematics inherent to strong line H ii
methods, which are routinely applied to massive data sets of galaxies.
We find [Z] = +0.07 {\plusmn} 0.03 and compare our measurements to H ii

redistribution of metal-rich gas following the strong interaction.

  Abstract                 = {{An overview of our current understanding of the formation and evolution
of star clusters is given, with main emphasis on high-mass clusters.
Clusters form deeply embedded within dense clouds of molecular gas.
Left-over gas is cleared within a few million years and, depending on
the efficiency of star formation, the clusters may disperse almost
immediately or remain gravitationally bound. Current evidence suggests
that a few percent of star formation occurs in clusters that remain
bound, although it is not yet clear if this fraction is truly universal.
Internal two-body relaxation and external shocks will lead to further,
gradual dissolution on timescales of up to a few hundred million years
for low-mass open clusters in the Milky Way, while the most massive
clusters ({\gt} 10\^{}5 Msun) have lifetimes comparable to or exceeding the
age of the Universe. The low-mass end of the initial cluster mass
function is well approximated by a power-law distribution, dN/dM \~{}
M\^{}$\{$-2$\}$, but there is mounting evidence that quiescent spiral discs form
relatively few clusters with masses M {\gt} 2 x 10\^{}5 Msun. In starburst
galaxies and old globular cluster systems, this limit appears to be
higher, at least several x 10\^{}6 Msun. The difference is likely related
to the higher gas densities and pressures in starburst galaxies, which
allow denser, more massive giant molecular clouds to form. Low-mass
clusters may thus trace star formation quite universally, while the more
long-lived, massive clusters appear to form preferentially in the
context of violent star formation.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. In the context of the space missions CoRoT, Kepler, Gaia, TESS,
and PLATO, precise and accurate stellar ages, masses, and radii are of
paramount importance. For instance, they are crucial for constraining
scenarii of planetary formation and evolution. <BR /> Aims: We aim at
quantifying how detailed stellar modelling can improve the accuracy and
precision on age and mass of individual stars. To that end, we adopt a
multifaceted approach where we carefully examine how the number of
observational constraints as well as the uncertainties on observations
and on model input physics affect the results of age-dating and
weighing. <BR /> Methods: We modelled in detail the exoplanet host-star
HD 52265, a main-sequence, solar-like oscillator that CoRoT observed for
four months. We considered different sets of observational constraints
(Hertzsprung-Russell data, metallicity, various sets of seismic
constraints). For each case, we determined the age, mass, and properties
of HD 52265 inferred from stellar models, and we quantified the impact
of the model input physics and free parameters. We also compared model
ages with ages derived by empirical methods or Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram inversion. <BR /> Results: For our case study HD 52265, our
seismic analysis provides an age A = 2.10-2.54 Gyr, a mass M = 1.14-1.32
M$_{&sun;}$, and a radius R = 1.30-1.34 R$_{&sun;}$, which
corresponds to age, mass, and radius uncertainties of \~{}10, \~{}7, and \~{}1.5
per cent, respectively. These uncertainties account for observational
errors and current state-of-the-art stellar model uncertainties. Our
seismic study also provides constraints on surface convection properties
through the mixing-length, which we find to be 12-15 per cent lower than
the solar value. On the other hand, because of helium-mass degeneracy,
the initial helium abundance is determined modulo the mass value.
Finally, we evaluate the seismic mass of the exoplanet to be
M$_{p}$sini = 1.17-1.26 M$_{Jupiter}$, much more precise
than what can be derived by Hertzsprung-Russell diagram inversion. <BR
/> Conclusions: We demonstrate that asteroseismology allows us to
substantially improve the age accuracy that can be achieved with other
methods. We emphasize that the knowledge of the mean properties of
stellar oscillations - such as the large frequency separation - is not
enough to derive accurate ages. We need precise individual frequencies
to narrow the age scatter that is a result of the model input physics
uncertainties. Further progress is required to better constrain the
physics at work in stars and the stars helium content. Our results
emphasize the importance of precise classical stellar parameters and
oscillation frequencies such as will be obtained by the Gaia and PLATO
missions.

depends on reliable models of stellar atmospheres and appropriate
techniques for spectral synthesis. Various model codes and strategies
for the analysis of stellar spectra are available today. <BR /> Aims: We
aim to compare the results of deriving stellar parameters using
different atmosphere models and different analysis strategies. The focus
is set on high-resolution spectroscopy of cool giant stars. <BR />
Methods: Spectra representing four cool giant stars were made available
to various groups and individuals working in the area of spectral
synthesis, asking them to derive stellar parameters from the data
provided. The results were discussed at a workshop in Vienna in 2010.
Most of the major codes currently used in the astronomical community for
analyses of stellar spectra were included in this experiment. <BR />
Results: We present the results from the different groups, as well as an
additional experiment comparing the synthetic spectra produced by
various codes for a given set of stellar parameters. Similarities and
differences of the results are discussed. <BR /> Conclusions: Several
valid approaches to analyze a given spectrum of a star result in quite a
wide range of solutions. The main causes for the differences in
parameters derived by different groups seem to lie in the physical input
data and in the details of the analysis method. This clearly shows how
far from a definitive abundance analysis we still are.

star-by-star comparison with degraded spectra from the ELODIE spectral
library and with a set of moderately high-resolution (R = 15, 000) and
medium-resolution (R = 6000) spectra of SDSS/SEGUE stars, we demonstrate
that we are able to measure [{$\alpha$}/Fe] from SDSS/SEGUE spectra (with
S/N{\gt}20/1) to a precision of better than 0.1 dex, for stars with
atmospheric parameters in the range T $_{eff}$ = [4500, 7000] K,
log g = [1.5, 5.0], and [Fe/H] = [-1.4, +0.3], over the range
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] = [-0.1, +0.6]. For stars with [Fe/H] {\lt}-1.4, our method
requires spectra with slightly higher signal-to-noise to achieve this
precision (S/N{\gt}25/1). Over the full temperature range considered, the
lowest metallicity star for which a confident estimate of [{$\alpha$}/Fe]
can be obtained from our approach is [Fe/H] \~{}-2.5 preliminary tests
indicate that a metallicity limit as low as [Fe/H] \~{}-3.0 may apply to
cooler stars. As a further validation of this approach, weighted
averages of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] obtained for SEGUE spectra of likely member
stars of Galactic globular clusters (M15, M13, and M71) and open
clusters (NGC 2420, M67, and NGC 6791) exhibit good agreement with the
values of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] from previous studies. The results of the
comparison with NGC 6791 imply that the metallicity range for the method

  Abstract                 = {{We describe an application of the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline
(SSPP) to medium-resolution stellar spectra obtained by the Large Sky
Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), in order to
determine estimates of the stellar atmospheric parameters
(T$_{eff}$, $\{$log$\}$ g, and [Fe/H]) and the abundance ratios
([{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [C/Fe]). By performing a coordinate match with the
LAMOST stellar database, we selected stars with LAMOST spectra in common
with stars having available spectroscopy from the Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), the RAdial Velocity
Experiment (RAVE), and the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding
and Exploration (SEGUE). We ran the selected LAMOST stellar spectra from
each survey through SSPP, and compared the stellar parameters down to
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 and chemical abundances down to S/N =
20 derived by SSPP with those determined by the APOGEE, RAVE, and SEGUE
software pipelines. Our results show that the derived stellar parameters
generally agree quite well, even though there exist some small
systematic offsets with small scatter in T$_{eff}$, $\{$log$\}$ g, and
[Fe/H], due to the use of different temperature scales, abundance
scales, and calibrations adopted by each survey. Comparison of the
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] determinations for LAMOST spectra suggests no sign of
significant systematic offsets ($\lt$-0.04 dex), with a small
scatter ($\lt$0.08 dex) relative to stars in common with APOGEE and
SEGUE. The [C/Fe] estimates determined for the LAMOST spectra also
exhibit good agreement, with a very small offset ({\tilde}0.01 dex) and
scatter ({\tilde}0.12 dex) relative to the SEGUE stars, while there exists
about a -0.19 dex offset, with a small scatter of {\tilde}0.13 dex,
for the APOGEE sample. Due to the existence of small offsets in the
stellar parameters and abundances among difference data sets, optimal
results when combining the different data sets will be obtained by
removing the offsets. Once accomplished, the stellar parameters and
chemical abundances estimated by SSPP from the LAMOST stellar spectra
should provide a reliable database for studies of the Galactic disk and
halo systems.

the Milky Way, based on a sample of over 100,000 main-sequence turnoff
stars with available spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
This map, which explores distances up to 15 kpc from the Sun, reveals
clear evidence for the dual nature of the Galactic halo, based on the
spatial distribution of stellar carbonicity. The metallicity
distribution functions of stars in the inner- and outer-halo regions of
the carbonicity map reproduce those previously argued to arise from
contributions of the inner- and outer-halo populations, with peaks at
[Fe/H] = -1.5 and -2.2, respectively. From consideration of the absolute
carbon abundances for our sample, A(C), we also confirm that the
carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the outer-halo region exhibit
a higher frequency of CEMP-no stars (those with no overabundances of
heavy neutron-capture elements) than of CEMP-s stars (those with strong
overabundances of elements associated with the s-process), whereas the
stars in the inner-halo region exhibit a higher frequency of CEMP-s
stars. We argue that the contrast in the behavior of the CEMP-no and
CEMP-s fractions in these regions arises from differences in the mass
distributions of the mini-halos from which the stars of the inner- and
outer-halo populations formed, which gives rise in turn to the observed
dichotomy of the Galactic halo.

  Abstract                 = {{We describe a method for the determination of stellar [C/Fe] abundance
ratios using low-resolution (R = 2000) stellar spectra from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and its Galactic sub-survey, the Sloan
Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE). By means
of a star-by-star comparison with a set of SDSS/SEGUE spectra with
available estimates of [C/Fe] based on published high-resolution
analyses, we demonstrate that we can measure [C/Fe] from SDSS/SEGUE
spectra with S/N $\gt$= 15 {\AA}$^{-1}$ to a precision
better than 0.35 dex for stars with atmospheric parameters in the range
T $_{eff}$ = [4400, 6700] K, log g = [1.0, 5.0], [Fe/H] =
[-4.0, +0.5], and [C/Fe] = [-0.25, +3.5]. Using the measured
carbon-to-iron abundance ratios obtained by this technique, we derive
the frequency of carbon-enhanced stars ([C/Fe] $\gt$= +0.7) as a function
of [Fe/H], for both the SDSS/SEGUE stars and other samples from the
literature. We find that the differential frequency slowly rises from
almost zero to about 14\% at [Fe/H] \~{} -2.4, followed by a sudden
increase, by about a factor of three, to 39\% from [Fe/H] \~{} -2.4 to
[Fe/H] \~{} -3.7. Although the number of stars known with [Fe/H] $\lt$
-4.0 remains small, the frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor
(CEMP) stars below this value is around 75\%. We also examine how the
cumulative frequency of CEMP stars varies across different luminosity
classes. The giant sample exhibits a cumulative CEMP frequency of 32\%
for [Fe/H] $\lt$= -2.5, 31\% for [Fe/H] $\lt$= -3.0, and 33\%
for [Fe/H] $\lt$= -3.5 a roughly constant value. For the
main-sequence turnoff stars, we obtain a lower cumulative CEMP
frequency, around 10\% for [Fe/H] $\lt$= -2.5, presumably due to the
difficulty of identifying CEMP stars among warmer turnoff stars with
weak CH G-bands. The dwarf population displays a large change in the
cumulative frequency for CEMP stars below [Fe/H] = -2.5, jumping
from 15\% for [Fe/H] $\lt$= -2.5 to about 75\% for [Fe/H] $\lt$=
-3.0. When we impose a restriction with respect to distance from
the Galactic mid-plane (|Z| $\lt$ 5 kpc), the frequency of the CEMP
giants does not increase at low metallicity ([Fe/H] $\lt$ -2.5),
but rather decreases due to the dilution of C-rich material in stars
that have undergone mixing with CNO-processed material from their
interiors. The frequency of CEMP stars near the main-sequence turnoff,
which are not expected to have experienced mixing, increases for [Fe/H]
$\lt$= -3.0. The general rise in the global CEMP frequency at low
metallicity is likely due to the transition from the inner-halo to the
outer-halo stellar populations with declining metallicity and increasing
distance from the plane.

atmosphere models. <BR />Results: Abundances were obtained with rms
accuracies of about 0.05-0.10 dex for Fe, and 0.05-0.20 dex for the
other elements. Cepheids in our sample have solar-like abundances, and
current measurements agree quite well with previous determinations. We

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Galactic abundance gradients set strong constraints to
chemo-dynamical evolutionary models of the Milky Way. Given the
period-luminosity relations that provide accurate distances and the
large number of spectral lines, Cepheids are excellent tracers of the
present-day abundance gradients. <BR /> Aims: We want to measure the
Galactic abundance gradient of several chemical elements. While the
slope of the Cepheid iron gradient did not vary much from the very first
studies, the gradients of the other elements are not that well
constrained. In this paper we focus on the inner and outer regions of
the Galactic thin disk. <BR /> Methods: We use high-resolution spectra
(FEROS, ESPADONS, NARVAL) to measure the abundances of several light
(Na, Al), {$\alpha$} (Mg, Si, S, Ca), and heavy elements (Y, Zr, La, Ce,
Nd, Eu) in a sample of 65 Milky Way Cepheids. Combining these results
with accurate distances from period-Wesenheit relations in the
near-infrared enables us to determine the abundance gradients in the
Milky Way. <BR /> Results: Our results are in good agreement with
previous studies on either Cepheids or other tracers. In particular, we
confirm an upward shift of {\ap}0.2 dex for the Mg abundances, as has
recently been reported. We also confirm the existence of a gradient for
all the heavy elements studied in the context of a local thermodynamic
equilibrium analysis. However, for Y, Nd, and especially La, we find
lower abundances for Cepheids in the outer disk than reported in
previous studies, leading to steeper gradients. This effect can be
explained by the differences in the line lists used by different groups.
<BR /> Conclusions: Our data do not support a flattening of the
gradients in the outer disk, in agreement with recent Cepheid studies
and chemo-dynamical simulations. This is in contrast to the open cluster
observations but remains compatible with a picture where the transition
zone between the inner disk and the outer disk would move outward with
time.

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Classical Cepheids are excellent tracers of intermediate-mass
stars, since their distances can be estimated with very high accuracy.
In particular, they can be adopted to trace the chemical evolution of
the Galactic disk. <BR />Aims: Homogeneous iron abundance measurements
for 33 Galactic Cepheids located in the outer disk together with
accurate distance determinations based on near-infrared photometry are
adopted to constrain the Galactic iron gradient beyond 10 kpc. <BR
/>Methods: Iron abundances were determined using high resolution Cepheid
spectra collected with three different observational instruments:
ESPaDOnS@CFHT, Narval@TBL and FEROS@2.2m ESO/MPG telescope. Cepheid
distances were estimated using near-infrared (J,H,K-band)
period-luminosity relations and data from SAAO and the 2MASS catalog.
<BR />Results: The least squares solution over the entire data set
indicates that the iron gradient in the Galactic disk presents a slope
of -0.052{\plusmn}0.003 textrm $\{$dex kpc$\}$$^{-1}$ in the 5-17 kpc
range. However, the change of the iron abundance across the disk seems
to be better described by a linear regime inside the solar circle and a
flattening of the gradient toward the outer disk (beyond 10 kpc). In the
latter region the iron gradient presents a shallower slope, i.e.
-0.012{\plusmn}0.014 textrm $\{$dex kpc$\}$$^{-1}$. In the outer disk
(10-12 kpc) we also found that Cepheids present an increase in the
spread in iron abundance. Current evidence indicates that the spread in
metallicity depends on the Galactocentric longitude. Finally, current
data do not support the hypothesis of a discontinuity in the iron
gradient at Galactocentric distances of 10-12 kpc. <BR />Conclusions:
The occurrence of a spread in iron abundance as a function of the
Galactocentric longitude indicates that linear radial gradients should
be cautiously treated to constrain the chemical evolution across the
disk.

  Abstract                 = {{Resonances play an important role in the evolution of the disks of
spiral galaxies, and in particular in the chemical abundance evolution.
The dominant effect is that of corotation; this effect can be even used
as a tool to estimate the age of the present spiral arm pattern, which
are usually found to be long-lived, contrary to a recent common belief.
We investigated a sample of galaxies for which the corotation radius is
known and for which there are available in the literature measurements
of abundance gradients for Oxygen. A very good correlation is found
between corotation radii and the radii at which there is a break in the
slope of the gradients. The gradients are usually decreasing in the
inner regions and become flat or rising at larger radii. In several
galaxies, including the Milky Way, one observes not only a change in the
slope of the abundance gradient, but also an abrupt step in metallicity,
at corotation. This step is due to the fact that corotation separates
the disk of a galaxy in two regions (inside corotation and outside
corotation) which are isolated one from the other, so that the two sides
evolve in an independent way. The barrier between the two regions is
produced by the flow of gas in opposite directions in the two sides and
by the ring-shaped void of gas observed at corotation. Besides this, an
independent effect of corotation is a minimum of star formation
associated with the minimum velocity at which the spiral arms (seen as
potential wells) are fed with interstellar gas. Still another effect is
the scattering of stars by the resonance, which causes their migration
to different galactic radii. Other resonances, like 4:1, have properties
almost opposite to corotation; they stimulate star-formation, and tend
to gather the stars in the resonant orbit, instead of scattering them
out, as shown by numerical simulations. Due to this property, one can
see arms which have the shape of resonant stellar orbits, which depart
from logarithmic spirals.

  Abstract                 = {{The 2dF (Two-degree Field) facility at the prime focus of the
Anglo-Australian Telescope provides multiple-object spectroscopy over a
2{\deg} field of view. Up to 400 target fibres can be independently
positioned by a complex robot. Two spectrographs provide spectra with
resolutions of between 500 and 2000, over wavelength ranges of 440 and
110nm respectively. The 2dF facility began routine observations in 1997.
2dF was designed primarily for galaxy redshift surveys and has a number
of innovative features. The large corrector lens incorporates an
atmospheric dispersion compensator, essential for wide wavelength
coverage with small-diameter fibres. The instrument has two full sets of
fibres on separate field plates, so that re-configuring can be done in
parallel with observing. The robot positioner places one fibre every 6s,
to a precision of 0.3arcsec (20{$\mu$}m) over the full field. All
components of 2dF, including the spectrographs, are mounted on a 5-m
diameter telescope top end ring for ease of handling and to keep the
optical fibres short in order to maximize UV throughput. There is a
pipeline data reduction system which allows each data set to be fully
analysed while the next field is being observed. 2dF has achieved its
initial astronomical goals. The redshift surveys obtain spectra at the
rate of 2500 galaxies per night, yielding a total of about 200000
objects in the first four years. Typically a B=19 galaxy gives a
spectrum with a signal-to-noise ratio of better than 10 per pixel in
less than an hour; redshifts are derived for about 95 per cent of all
galaxies, with 99 per cent reliability or better. Total system
throughput is about 5 per cent. The failure rate of the positioner and
fibre system is about 1:10000 moves or once every few nights, and
recovery time is usually short. In this paper we provide the historical
background to the 2dF facility, the design philosophy, a full technical
description and a summary of the performance of the instrument. We also
briefly review its scientific applications and possible future
developments.

to discuss the extent to which elemental abundances can be used as
discriminators between different (known and unknown) stellar populations

terms of precision in elemental abundances, as derived from
spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way's stellar populations, in order
to detect interesting substructures in elemental abundance space. <BR />
Methods: We used Monte Carlo simulations to examine under which
conditions substructures in elemental abundance space can realistically
be detected. <BR /> Results: We present a simple relation between the
minimum number of stars needed to detect a given substructure and the
precision of the measurements. The results are in agreement with recent
small- and large-scale studies, with high and low precision,
respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: Large-number statistics cannot fully
compensate for low precision in the abundance measurements. Each survey
should carefully evaluate what the main science drivers are for the
survey and ensure that the chosen observational strategy will result in
the precision necessary to answer the questions posed.

than 1 billion stars brighter than magnitude 20.7 based on observations
collected by the Gaia satellite during the first 14 months of its
operational phase. <BR /> Aims: We give a brief overview of the
astrometric content of the data release and of the model assumptions,
data processing, and validation of the results. <BR /> Methods: For
stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues, complete
astrometric single-star solutions are obtained by incorporating
positional information from the earlier catalogues. For other stars only
their positions are obtained, essentially by neglecting their proper
motions and parallaxes. The results are validated by an analysis of the
residuals, through special validation runs, and by comparison with
external data. <BR /> Results: For about two million of the brighter
stars (down to magnitude 11.5) we obtain positions, parallaxes, and
proper motions to Hipparcos-type precision or better. For these stars,
systematic errors depending for example on position and colour are at a
level of {\plusmn} 0.3 milliarcsecond (mas). For the remaining stars we
obtain positions at epoch J2015.0 accurate to 10 mas. Positions and
proper motions are given in a reference frame that is aligned with the
International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) to better than 0.1 mas at
epoch J2015.0, and non-rotating with respect to ICRF to within 0.03 mas
yr$^{-1}$. The Hipparcos reference frame is found to rotate with
respect to the Gaia DR1 frame at a rate of 0.24 mas yr$^{-1}$. <BR /> Conclusions: Based on less than a quarter of the nominal mission
length and on very provisional and incomplete calibrations, the quality
and completeness of the astrometric data in Gaia DR1 are far from what
is expected for the final mission products. The present results
nevertheless represent a huge improvement in the available fundamental
stellar data and practical definition of the optical reference frame.

Despite its overwhelming success, there is a distinct lack of mathematical foundations and the inner workings of the algorithm are not well understood. The purpose of this paper is to prove that t-SNE is able to recover well-separated clusters; more precisely, we prove that t-SNE in the `early exaggeration' phase, an optimization technique proposed by van der Maaten & Hinton (2008) and van der Maaten (2014), can be rigorously analyzed. As a byproduct, the proof suggests novel ways for setting the exaggeration parameter $\alpha$ and step size $h$. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of these rules: in particular, the quality of embedding of topological structures (e.g. the swiss roll) improves. We also discuss a connection to spectral clustering methods.},

  Abstract                 = {{We present a statistical method to derive the stellar density profiles
of the Milky Way from spectroscopic survey data, taking into account
selection effects. We assume that the selection function of the
spectroscopic survey is only based on photometric colors and magnitudes.
Then the underlying selection function can be well recovered by
comparing the distribution of the spectroscopic stars in a
color-magnitude plane with that of the photometric dataset.
Subsequently, the stellar density profile along a line-of-sight can be
derived from the spectroscopically measured stellar density profile
multiplied by the selection function. The method is validated using
Galaxia mock data with two different selection functions. We demonstrate
that the derived stellar density profiles well reconstruct the true ones
not only for the full targets, but also for the sub-populations selected
from the full dataset. Finally, the method is applied to map the density
profiles for the Galactic disk and halo, respectively, using the LAMOST
RGB stars. The Galactic disk extends to about R = 19 kpc, where the disk
still contributes about 10\% to the total stellar surface density. Beyond
this radius, the disk smoothly transitions to the halo without any
truncation, bending, or breaking. Moreover, no over-density
corresponding to the Monoceros ring is found in the Galactic anti-center
direction. The disk shows north-south asymmetry when at radii larger
than 12 kpc. On the other hand, the R--Z tomographic map directly shows
that the stellar halo is substantially oblate within a Galactocentric
radius of 20 kpc and gradually becomes nearly spherical beyond 30 kpc.

  Abstract                 = {{As a major component of the LAMOST Galactic surveys, the LAMOST
Spectroscopic Survey of the Galactic Anti-center (LSS-GAC) will survey a
significant volume of the Galactic thin/thick disks and halo in a
contiguous sky area of \~{}3,400 sq.deg., centered on the Galactic
anti-center (|b| $\lt$= 30{\deg}, 150 $\lt$= l $\lt$= 210{\deg}), and obtain
{$\lambda$}{$\lambda$}3800-9000 low resolution (R \~{}1,800) spectra for a
statistically complete sample of $\gt$\~{} 3 M stars of all colors,
uniformly and randomly selected from (r, g - r) and (r, r - i) Hess
diagrams obtained from a CCD imaging photometric survey of \~{}5,400
sq.deg. with the Xuyi 1.04/1.20 m Schmidt Telescope, ranging from r =
14.0 to a limiting magnitude of r = 17.8 (18.5 for limited fields). The
survey will deliver spectral classification, radial velocity (V
$_{r}$) and stellar parameters (effective temperature (T
$_{eff}$), surface gravity (log g) and metallicity [Fe/H]) for
millions of Galactic stars. Together with Gaia which will provide
accurate distances and tangential velocities for a billion stars, the
LSS-GAC will yield a unique data set to study the stellar populations,
chemical composition, kinematics and structure of the disks and their
interface with the halo, identify streams of debris of tidally disrupted
dwarf galaxies and clusters, probe the gravitational potential and dark
matter distribution, map the 3D distribution of interstellar dust
extinction, search for rare objects (e.g. extremely metal-poor or
hyper-velocity stars), and ultimately advance our understanding of the
assemblage of the Milky Way and other galaxies and the origin of
regularity and diversity of their properties.

The survey was initiated in the fall of 2012 and expected to complete in
the spring of 2017. Hitherto, about 0.4 M spectra of S/N({$\lambda$}7450)
$\gt$= 10 per pixel have been accumulated. In addition, bright nights
have been used to target stars brighter than 14 mag and have so far
generated over 0.4 M spectra, yielding an excellent sample of local
stars to probe the solar neighborhood. LSP3, a set of pipelines tailored
to the need of LSS-GAC, for spectral flux-calibration, and radial
velocity and stellar parameter determinations, have been developed at
Peking University, based on packages developed for the SDSS and those at
the National Astronomical Observatories of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Comparisons of multi-epoch observations, with the SDSS results, as well
as applying the pipelines to open and globular clusters show that LSP3
has achieved a precision of 5 km s$^{-1}$, 110 K, 0.15 dex and
0.15 dex for V $_{r}$, T $_{eff}$, log g and [Fe/H],
respectively. The data are publicly available, subject to regulations of
the LAMOST data policy, and begin to yield scientific results. The
potential of LSS-GAC and power of existing data are illustrated with
examples of selected problems.

M$_{Earth}$ and a ''Neptune'' planet with minimum mass of 18
M$_{Earth}$, both orbiting their parent stars within a distance of
0.05 AU and a period of approximately four days. These detections
strengthen the argument that low-mass planets are primarily found in
multiple-planetary systems.

outer part of the galactic disc, this paper presents results on the
metallicicty distribution over galactocentric distances up to 15 kpc.
The outer disc is clearly separated from the middle part by the
existence of a step in the metallicity distribution at about 10 kpc.
Taking the region of galactocentric distances from 10 kpc to 15 kpc, one
can derive an iron gradient -0.03 +/- 0.01 dex kpc$^{-1}$ (25
stars). The existence of a discontinuity can be caused by the effective
suppression of mixing processes near the corotation circle where the
radial component of the gas velocity should be very small.

Silla, Chile, under programme 68.D-0201(B).

find that there exists in the Galactic disk at that longitude and at a
solar distance of about 3-4 kpc a region that has enhanced abundances,
$\lt$Fe/H]$\gt$\~{}+0.2, with respect to the local region. A simple linear
fit to all Cepheid data now extant yields a gradient
d[Fe/H]/dR$_{G}$=-0.068+/-0.003 dex kpc$^{-1}$. After
consideration of the spatial abundance inhomogeneities in the sample, we
conclude that the best current estimate of the overall gradient is
d[Fe/H]/dR$_{G}$=-0.06 dex kpc$^{-1}$.

  Abstract                 = {{We present an asteroseismic analysis of 33 solar-type stars observed in
short cadence during Campaigns (C) 1-3 of the NASA K2 mission. We were
able to extract both average seismic parameters and individual mode
frequencies for stars with dominant frequencies up to \~{}3300$\{$$\backslash$mu$\}$Hz, and
we find that data for some targets are good enough to allow for a
measurement of the rotational splitting. Modelling of the extracted
parameters is performed by using grid-based methods using average
parameters and individual frequencies together with spectroscopic
parameters. For the target selection in C3, stars were chosen as in C1
and C2 to cover a wide range in parameter space to better understand the
performance and noise characteristics. For C3 we still detected
oscillations in 73\% of the observed stars that we proposed. Future K2
campaigns hold great promise for the study of nearby clusters and the
chemical evolution and age-metallicity relation of nearby field stars in
the solar neighbourhood. We expect oscillations to be detected in \~{}388
short-cadence targets if the K2 mission continues until C18, which will
greatly complement the \~{}500 detections of solar-like oscillations made
for short-cadence targets during the nominal Kepler mission. For \~{}30-40
of these, including several members of the Hyades open cluster, we
furthermore expect that inference from interferometry should be
possible.

  Abstract                 = {{With the loss of a second reaction wheel, resulting in the inability to
point continuously and stably at the same field of view, the NASA Kepler
satellite recently entered a new mode of observation known as the K2
mission. The data from this redesigned mission present a specific
challenge; the targets systematically drift in position on an {\sim}6 hr
timescale, inducing a significant instrumental signal in the photometric
time series{\mdash}this greatly impacts the ability to detect planetary
signals and perform asteroseismic analysis. Here we detail our version
of a reduction pipeline for K2 target pixel data, which automatically
defines masks for all targets in a given frame; extracts the
target{\rsquo}s flux and position time series; corrects the time series
based on the apparent movement on the CCD (either in 1D or 2D), combined
with the correction of instrumental and/or planetary signals via the
Kepler Asteroseismic Science Operations Center (KASOC) filter, thus
rendering the time series ready for asteroseismic analysis; computes
power spectra for all targets and identifies potential contaminations
between targets. From a test of our pipeline on a sample of targets from
the K2 campaign 0, the recovery of data for multiple targets increases
the amount of potential light curves by a factor of {\ge}slant 10. Our
pipeline could be applied to the upcoming TESS and PLATO 2.0 missions.

previous work, where the expected Gaia Catalogue content was reviewed
but without the simulation of observational errors. <BR /> Methods: We
analysed the Gaia Object Generator (GOG) catalogue using the Gaia
Analysis Tool (GAT), thereby producing a number of statistics about the
catalogue. <BR /> Results: A simulated catalogue of one billion objects
is presented, with detailed information on the 523 million individual
single stars it contains. Detailed information is provided for the
expected errors in parallax, position, proper motion, radial velocity,
and the photometry in the four Gaia bands. Information is also given on
the expected performance of physical parameter determination, including
temperature, metallicity, and line-of-sight extinction.

  Abstract                 = {{We study the structure, age and metallicity gradients, and dynamical
evolution using a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-mass
galaxy from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project. In the
simulation, stars older than 6 Gyr were formed in a chaotic, bursty mode
and have the largest vertical scaleheights (1.5-2.5 kpc) by z = 0, while
stars younger than 6 Gyr were formed in a relatively calm, stable disc.
The vertical scaleheight increases with stellar age at all radii,
because (1) stars that formed earlier were thicker 'at birth', and (2)
stars were kinematically heated to an even thicker distribution after
formation. Stars of the same age are thicker in the outer disc than in
the inner disc (flaring). These lead to positive vertical age gradients
and negative radial age gradients. The radial metallicity gradient is
negative at the mid-plane, flattens at larger disc height |Z|, and turns
positive above |Z| {\tilde} 1.5 kpc. The vertical metallicity gradient is
negative at all radii, but is steeper at smaller radii. These trends
broadly agree with observations in the Milky Way and can be naturally
understood from the age gradients. The vertical stellar density profile
can be well described by two components, with scaleheights 200-500 pc
and 1-1.5 kpc, respectively. The thick component is a mix of stars older
than 4 Gyr, which formed through a combination of several mechanisms.
Our results also demonstrate that it is possible to form a thin disc in
cosmological simulations even with a strong stellar feedback.

Tycho-2 BT and VT, Str{\"o}mgren uvby, and Johnson UBV. For Tycho-2, I
revisit the analysis of an earlier paper to include the new
recalibration of grating/aperture corrections, vignetting, and charge
transfer inefficiency effects produced by the Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph group and to consider the consequences of both random and
systematic uncertainties. The new results reaffirm the good quality of
both the Tycho-2 photometry and the HST spectrophotometry but yield a
slightly different value for ZP$_{B<SUB>T}$-V$_{T}$</SUB> of
0.033+/-0.001 (random) +/-0.005 (systematic) mag. For the Str{\"o}mgren
v, b, and y filters I find that the published sensitivity curves are
consistent with the available photometry and spectrophotometry, and I
derive new values for the associated ZP$_{b-y}$ and
ZP$_{m<SUB>1}$</SUB>. The same conclusion is drawn for the Johnson
B and V filters and the associated ZP$_{B-V}$. The situation is
different for the Str{\"o}mgren u and the Johnson U filters. There I
find that the published sensitivity curves yield results that are
inconsistent with the available photometry and spectrophotometry, likely
caused by an incorrect treatment of atmospheric effects on the
short-wavelength end. I reanalyze the data to produce new average
sensitivity curves for those two filters and new values for
ZP$_{c<SUB>1}$</SUB> and ZP$_{U-B}$. The new computation of
synthetic U-B and B-V colors uses a single B sensitivity curve, which
eliminates the previous unphysical existence of different definitions
for each color. Finally, I find that if one uses values from the
literature for which uncertainties are not given, reasonable estimates
for these are 1\%-2\% for Str{\"o}mgren b-y, m$_{1}$, and
c$_{1}$ and 2\%-3\% for Johnson B-V and U-B. The use of the results
in this paper should lead to a significant reduction of systematic
errors when comparing synthetic photometry models with real colors and
indices.

work, we analyze the behaviour of radial abundance gradients in the
galactic disk giving special emphasis on these variations. The data used
includes planetary nebulae and objects in different age brackets, namely
open clusters, HII regions, cepheid variables and stars in OB
associations. We find evidences for a space variation of the radial
gradients as measured for element ratios such as O/H, S/H, Ne/H, Ar/H
and [Fe/H], in the sense that the gradients tend to flatten out at large
galactocentric distances. Moreover, near the bulge-disk interface a
steep decrease in the abundances is observed. The time evolution of the
gradients is also evaluated on the basis of approximate ages attributed
to the central stars of planetary nebulae and open cluster stars. It is
concluded that the available data is consistent with a time flattening
of the gradients during the last 6 to 8 Gyr, a time interval in which
the age determinations are probably more accurate.

objects can be used to determine the gradients, such as HII regions, B
stars, Cepheids, open clusters and planetary nebulae. Several elements
can be studied, such as oxygen, sulphur, neon, and argon in photoionized
nebulae, and iron and other elements in cepheids, open clusters and
stars. As a consequence, the number of observational characteristics
inferred from the study of abundance gradients is very large, so that in
the past few years they have become one of the main observational
constraints of chemical evolution models. In this paper, we present some
recent observational evidences of abundance gradients based on several
classes of objects. We will focus on (i) the magnitude of the gradients,
(ii) the space variations, and (iii) the evidences of a time variation
of the abundance gradients. Some comments on recent theoretical models
are also given, in an effort to highlight their predictions concerning
abundance gradients and their variations.

similar or slightly higher oxygen abundances compared with the older
objects, and the gradients of both groups are similar within the
uncertainties. Therefore, the O/H radial gradient has not changed
appreciably during the lifetime of the objects considered, so that PN
gradients are not expected to be very different from the gradients
observed in younger objects, which seems to be supported by recent
observational data.

  Abstract                 = {{Radial abundance gradients are a common feature of spiral galaxies, and
in the case of the Galaxy both the magnitude of the gradients and their
variations are among the most important constraints of chemical
evolution models. Planetary nebulae (PN) are particularly interesting
objects to study the gradients and their variations. Owing to their
bright emission spectra, they can be observed even at large
galactocentric distances, and the derived abundances are relatively
accurate, with uncertainties of about 0.1 to 0.2 dex, particularly for
the elements that are not synthesized in their progenitor stars. On the
other hand, as the offspring of intermediate mass stars, with main
sequence masses in the interval of 1 to 8 solar masses, they are
representative of objects with a reasonable age span. In this paper, we
present an estimate of the time variation of the O/H radial gradient in
a sample containing over 200 nebulae with accurate abundances. Our
results are consistent with a flattening of the O/H gradient roughly
from -0.11 dex/kpc to -0.06 dex/kpc during the last 9 Gyr, or from -0.08
dex/kpc to -0.06 dex/kpc during the last 5 Gyr.

consequences for models of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. We
present a comparison of the time variation of the abundance gradients in
the Milky Way disk as determined from a sample of planetary nebulae,
open clusters, cepheids and young objects, such as stars in OB
associations and HII regions. We conclude that the [Fe/H] gradients as
measured in open cluster stars strongly support the time flattening of
the abundance gradient as determined from O/H and S/H measurements in
planetary nebulae. This conclusion is also supported by the cepheid
variables, for which very accurate gradients and ages can be determined,
and also by some recent estimates for OB stars and HII regions. It is
estimated that the average flattening rate for the last 8 Gyr is in the
range 0.005-0.010 dex kpc$^{-1}$ Gyr$^{-1}$.

investigate the time evolution of the electron temperature gradient and
of the radial abundance gradient, which is essentially a mirror image of
the temperature gradient. <BR />Methods: The recently derived electron
temperature gradient from radio recombination lines in HII regions is
compared with a new determination of the corresponding gradient from
planetary nebulae for which the progenitor star ages have been
determined. <BR />Results: The newly derived electron temperature
gradient for PN with progenitor stars with ages in the 4-5 Gyr range is
much steeper than the corresponding gradient for HII regions. These
electron temperature gradients are converted into O/H gradients in order
to make comparisons with previous estimates of the flattening rate of

O/H gradient has flattened out in the past 5 Gyr at a rate of about
0.0094 dex kpc$^{-1}$ Gyr$^{-1}$, in good agreement with our

the expected rotation velocities of the nebulae at their Galactocentric

evolved stars. Adopting the relation between the ages and the velocity
dispersions determined by the Geneva-Copenhagen survey, the age
distribution can be derived. Second, the U, V, W, velocity components of
the stars are determined, and the corresponding age-velocity dispersion
relations are used to infer the age distribution. These methods have
been applied to two samples of PN in the Galaxy. The results are similar
for both samples, and show that the age distribution of the PN central
stars concentrates at ages lower than 5 Gyr, peaking at about 1 to 3
Gyr.

  Abstract                 = {{Spectroscopic surveys of the Galaxy reveal that its disc stars exhibit a
spread in $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ at fixed $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, manifest at
some locations as a bimodality. The origin of these diverse, and
possibly distinct, stellar populations in the Galactic disc is not well
understood. We examine the Fe and $\alpha$-element evolution of 133
Milky Way-like galaxies from the EAGLE simulation, to investigate the
origin and diversity of their $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$-$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$
distributions. We find that bimodal $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ distributions
arise in galaxies whose gas accretion histories exhibit episodes of
significant infall at both early and late times, with the former
fostering more intense star formation than the latter. The shorter
characteristic consumption timescale of gas accreted in the earlier
episode suppresses its enrichment with iron synthesised by Type Ia SNe,
resulting in the formation of a high-$\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ sequence. We
find that bimodality in $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ similar to that seen in
the Galaxy is rare, appearing in approximately 5 percent of galaxies in
our sample. We posit that this is a consequence of an early gas
accretion episode requiring the mass accretion history of a galaxy's
dark matter halo to exhibit a phase of atypically-rapid growth at early
epochs. The scarcity of EAGLE galaxies exhibiting distinct sequences in
the $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$-$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ plane may therefore
indicate that the Milky Way's elemental abundance patterns, and its
accretion history, are not representative of the broader population of
$\sim L^\star$ disc galaxies.

  Abstract                 = {{Over two decades ago, Oxygen was proposed as a superior tracer for
Galactic chemical evolution, and has, furthermore, been suggested to
exhibit a correlation with age for open clusters (hereafter OCs). This
dissertation presents the results to date of our long-term,
spectroscopic study of O in OC dwarfs. Our study seeks to explore the
potential of O as a chemical tracer by testing the [O/H]-versus-age
correlation previously found for OCs, and by examining other important
chemical evolution relationships, such as [O/Fe]-versus-[Fe/H]. Whereas
the reliability of the various stellar O abundance indicators has been
debated, we use recent developments for analysis of the oxygen triplet
at 7774A, in solar-type dwarfs, to eliminate various complications, thus
yielding reliable cluster O abundances. Our major conclusions are as
follows: (1) We do not find the robust [O/H]-versus-age correlation
previously implied. However, the young clusters that have age $\lt$ 1 Gyr
are completely distinguished from the old clusters by their
on-average-super-solar [O/H] values. These high O abundances contradict
the [O/H]-versus-age relationship predicted by chemical evolution models
which incorporate infall of metal-poor gas onto the Galactic Disk. We
argue that such an increase in O would result if infall ceased about
1--2 Gyr ago. (2) [O/H]-versus-age and [Fe/H]-versus-age both exhibit
scatter in the 4--7 Gyr age range, which may be chemical evidence of an
infall event. The reality of this scatter is supported by a constant,
near-solar [O/Fe] for the entire age $\gt$ 1 Gyr range, implying a
physical cause which preserves the abundance ratios. (3) The
[O/Fe]-versus-[Fe/H] relationship for OCs exhibits substantial scatter,
and is in contradiction to the trend observed in field stars, suggesting
that the chemical history of OCs is, in fact, different than that of
field stars. (4) The OCs exhibit a clear, roughly linear trend in
[Fe/O]-versus-[O/H], but shockingly, this trend contradicts the
well-defined, roughly linear trend exhibit by field stars, which has
opposite slope. This is strong evidence that the chemical history of OCs
is different than that of field stars, and specifically, may be clear
evidence for the effects of self-enrichment within cluster-forming
regions. (5) The super-metal-rich OC NGC 6253 appears to reflect a
different chemical history than that of the other OCs in the Galactic
Disk, and its combination of high abundances and old age is more similar
to stars of the Galactic bulge. We suggest that its abundance patterns
may be characteristic of supernova enrichment in a high-metallicity
regime.

super-metal-rich open cluster NGC 6253, with emphasis on its O
abundance. High-dispersion, 7774 {\AA} O i triplet region spectra of
47 stars were obtained using Hydra II on the CTIO Blanco 4 m. Radial
velocity analysis confirms 39 stars consistent with single star
membership, primarily at the turnoff. Thirty-six of these are included
in our abundance analysis. Our differential analysis relative to the Sun
yields primarily scaled-solar values, with weighted cluster averages of
[O/H] = +0.440 {\plusmn} 0.020, [Fe/H] = +0.445 {\plusmn} 0.014, [Al/H] =
+0.487 {\plusmn} 0.020, [Si/H] = +0.504 {\plusmn} 0.018, and [Ni/H] =
+0.702 {\plusmn} 0.018 (where the errors are $\{$$\{${$\sigma$} $\}$$_{mu
}$$\}$). We discuss possible origins for the three known
super-metal-rich clusters based upon their abundance patterns, Galactic
locations, and space motions. The abundance patterns of NGC 6253 are
very similar to those of NGC 6791 and NGC 6583. With the possible
exception of oxygen, the abundances of these clusters are all close to
scaled-solar, and they are similar to patterns seen in metal-rich disk
dwarfs and giants. However, they also seem to differ from those of
metal-rich bulge stars. We demonstrate that NGC 6253 is unusually oxygen
rich (in [O/H]) for its 3.3 Gyr age. While we find [O/Fe] to be
scaled-solar for NGC 6253, the more recently reported values for NGC
6791 show a large variation, from values close to scaled-solar down to
values at least a factor of two below scaled-solar. We discuss the
possibility that the scaled-solar [O/Fe] abundances of NGC 6253 and NGC
6791 might reflect a flattening of the Galactic [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H]
relationship. This possibility may be consistent with disk star
abundance data, which show an apparent {\ldquo}floor{\rdquo} at [O/Fe]
{\tilde} -0.1 for [Fe/H] $\backslash$gt 0, and with chemical evolution model results,
which may predict such a flattening due to a decrease in supernova Fe
yields at super-solar-metallicities. Orbit solutions for NGC 6791 allow
that it may have formed in the inner disk and was then kicked out, but
the origins of the other two much younger clusters remain mysterious. We
re-evaluate the age of NGC 6583 in view of the evidence that the cluster
is super-metal-rich, and confirm a probable age less than 1 Gyr (best
range: 500-900 Myr). We also argue that it is unlikely the cluster
is more than 3 kpc away (best range: 2-3 kpc) if the apparent
turnoff, main sequence, and giants are all cluster members.

  Abstract                 = {{Models of stellar evolution with rotation are very much needed in order
to interpret recent stellar properties, in particular for massive stars.
For that we proceed to a detailed investigation of some critical
physical processes in rotating stars: 1. The equation expressing the
transport of angular momentum by circulation and diffusion is revised to
also account for expansion and contraction in non-stationary models. 2.
We examine the current expressions for the velocity U(r) of the
meridional circulation, also taking into account mu -gradients and
horizontal turbulence. We show that there are no ``mu -currents'' but
just meridional currents which can be sizeably influenced by the
gradients of mean molecular weight mu . A proper account of the mu
-gradients may reduce U(r) by one or two orders of magnitude with
respect to current expressions. 3. While the usual expressions for the
meridional circulation would predict an infinite velocity at the edge of
a radiative and semiconvective zone and an inverted circulation in a
semiconvective zone, the present developments give a continuity of the
solutions for the circulation. 4. The approximation of a stationary
circulation, which is no longer valid after the main-sequence phase, is
also removed and the case of a general equation of state is considered.
We notice that in the stationary regime the horizontal fluctuations of
mu represent some fixed fraction of the vertical mu -gradient. To first
order, this fraction is not dependent on rotation, because the building
of horizontal fluctuations by the circulation is compensated by the
smoothing due to horizontal turbulence.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Our knowledge of the shape of radial metallicity gradients in
disc galaxies has recently improved. Conversely, the understanding of
their time evolution is more complex, since it requires analysis of
stellar populations with different ages or systematic studies of
galaxies at different redshifts. In the local Universe, H ii regions and
planetary nebulae (PNe) are important tools to investigate radial
metallicity gradients in disc galaxies. <BR /> Aims: We present an
in-depth study of all nearby spiral galaxies (M33, M31, NGC 300, and
M81) with direct-method nebular abundances of both populations, aiming
at studying the evolution of their radial metallicity gradients. For the
first time, we also evaluate the radial migration of PN populations. <BR
/> Methods: For the selected galaxies, we analysed H ii region and PN
properties to: determine whether oxygen in PNe is a reliable tracer for
past interstellar medium (ISM) composition; homogenise published
datasets; estimate the migration of the oldest stellar populations; and
determine the overall chemical enrichment and slope evolution. <BR />
Results: We confirm that oxygen in PNe is a reliable tracer for past ISM
metallicity. We find that PN gradients are flatter than or equal to
those of H ii regions. When radial motions are negligible, this result
provides a direct measurement of the time evolution of the gradient. For
galaxies with dominant radial motions, we provide upper limits on the
gradient evolution. Finally, the total metal content increases with time
in all target galaxies, and early morphological types have a larger
increment {$\Delta$}(O/H) than late-type galaxies. <BR /> Conclusions: Our
findings provide important constraints to discriminate among different
galactic evolutionary scenarios, favouring cosmological models with
enhanced feedback from supernovae. The advent of extremely large
telescopes allows us to include galaxies in a wider range of
morphologies and environments, thus putting firmer constraints on galaxy
formation and evolution scenarios.

Ar, finding a substantially homogenous composition in the ionised gas of
the disc of NGC 55, with no trace of radial gradients. The oxygen
abundances, both derived with $\backslash$te- and strong-line methods, have similar
mean values and similarly small dispersion:
12+$\log$(O/H)=8.13$\pm$0.18\~{}dex with the former and
12+$\log$(O/H)=8.17$\pm$0.13\~{}dex with the latter. The average
metallicities and the flat gradients agree with previous studies of
smaller samples of $\backslash$hii$\backslash$ regions and there is a qualitative agreement
with the blue supergiant radial gradient as well. We investigate the
origin of such flat gradients comparing NGC 55 with NGC 300, its
companion galaxy, which is also twin of NGC 55 in terms of mass and
luminosity. We suggest that the differences in the metal distributions
in the two galaxies might be related to the differences in their K-band
surface density profile. The flatter profile of NGC 55 probably causes
in this galaxy higher infall/outflow rates than in similar galaxies.
This likely provokes a strong mixing of gas and a re-distribution of
metals.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. The inner disc, which links the thin disc with the bulge, has
been somewhat neglected in the past because of the intrinsic
difficulties in its study, among which crowding and high extinction.
Open clusters located in the inner disc are among thebest tracers of its
chemistry at different ages and distances. <BR /> Aims: We analyse the
chemical patterns of four open clusters located within 7 kpc of the
Galactic centre and of field stars to infer the properties of the inner
disc with the Gaia-ESO survey idr2/3 data release. <BR /> Methods: We
derive the parameters of the newly observed cluster, Berkeley 81,
finding an age of about 1 Gyr and a Galactocentric distance of \~{}5.4 kpc.
We construct the chemical patterns of clusters and we compare them with
those of field stars in the solar neighbourhood and in the inner-disc
samples. <BR /> Results: Comparing the three populations we observe that
inner-disc clusters and field stars are both, on average, enhanced in
[O/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [Si/Fe]. Using the idr2/3 results of M67, we
estimate the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effect on the
abundances of Mg and Si in giant stars. After empirically correcting for
NLTE effects, we note that NGC 6705 and Be 81 still have a high
[{$\alpha$}/Fe]. <BR /> Conclusions: The location of the four open clusters
and of the field population reveals that the evolution of the
metallicity [Fe/H] and of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] can be explained within the
framework of a simple chemical evolution model: both [Fe/H] and
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] of Trumpler 20 and of NGC 4815 are in agreement with
expectations from a simple chemical evolution model. On the other hand,
NGC 6705, and to a lesser degree Berkeley 81, have higher [{$\alpha$}/Fe]
than expected for their ages, location in the disc, and metallicity.
These differences might originate from local enrichment processes as
explained in the inhomogeneous evolution framework.

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Open clusters offer a unique possibility to study the time
evolution of the radial metallicity gradients of several elements in our
Galaxy, because they span large intervals in age and Galactocentric
distance, and both quantities can be more accurately derived than for
field stars. <BR />Aims: We re-address the issue of the Galactic
metallicity gradient and its time evolution by comparing the empirical
gradients traced by a sample of 45 open clusters with a chemical
evolution model of the Galaxy. <BR />Methods: At variance with previous
similar studies, we have collected from the literature only abundances
derived from high-resolution spectra. The clusters have Galactocentric
distances 7 {\lap} R\_GC {\lap} 22 kpc and ages from \~{}30 Myr to 11 Gyr. We
also consider the {$\alpha$}-elements Si, Ca, Ti, and the iron-peak
elements Cr and Ni. Cepheids trace instead the present-day Fe gradient
in the inner parts of the disk. <BR />Results: The data for iron-peak
and {$\alpha$}-elements indicate a steep metallicity gradient for R\_GC{\lap}
12 kpc and a plateau at larger radii. The time evolution of the
metallicity distribution is characterized by a uniform increase of the
metallicity at all radii, preserving the shape of the gradient, with
marginal evidence for a flattening of the gradient with time in the
radial range 7-12 kpc. Our model is able to reproduce the main features
of the metallicity gradient and its evolution with an infall law
exponentially decreasing with radius and with a collapse time scale of
the order of 8 Gyr at the solar radius. This results in a rapid collapse
in the inner regions, i.e. R\_GC{\lap} 12 kpc (that we associate with an
early phase of disk formation from the collapse of the halo) and in a
slow inflow of material per unit area in the outer regions at a constant
rate with time (that we associate with accretion from the intergalactic
medium). An additional uniform inflow per unit disk area would help to
better reproduce the metallicity plateau at large Galactocentric radii,
but it is difficult to reconcile with the present-day radial behaviour
of the star formation rate. <BR />Conclusions: Our results favour a
scenario where the Galactic disk is formed inside-out by the rapid
collapse of the halo and by a subsequent continuous accretion of
intergalactic gas

spectroscopy with Hectospec at the MMT. In this paper, we present the
spectra of 102 PNe, whereas plasma diagnostic and chemical abundances
were performed on the 93 PNe where the necessary diagnostic lines were
measured. About 20\% of the PNe are compatible with being Type I; the
rest of the sample is the progeny of an old disk stellar population,
with main sequence masses M $\lt$ 3 M $_{sun}$ and ages t $\gt$ 0.3
Gyr. By studying the elemental abundances of the PNe in the M33 disk, we
were able to infer that (1) there is a tight correlation between O/H and
Ne/H, broadly excluding the evolution of oxygen; (2) the average
abundances of the {$\alpha$}-elements are consistent with those of H II
regions, indicating a negligible global enrichment in the disk of M33
from the epoch of the formation of the PN progenitors to the present
time; and (3) the radial oxygen gradient across the M33 disk has a slope
of -0.031 {\plusmn} 0.013 dex kpc$^{-1}$, in agreement, within the
errors, with the corresponding gradient derived from H II regions. Our
observations do not seem to imply that the metallicity gradient across
the M33 disk has flattened considerably with time. We report also the
discovery of a PN with Wolf-Rayet features, PN039, belonging the class
of late [WC] stars.

Observations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint
facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.

Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) has produced a large catalog of
high resolution ($\{$R = 22 500$\}$), high quality (S/N $\gt$ 100), infrared
(H-band) spectra for stars throughout all stellar populations of the
Milky Way, including in regions veiled by significant dust opacity.
APOGEE's half million spectra collected on $\gt$ 163 000 unique stars,
with time series information via repeat visits to each star, are being
applied to numerous problems in stellar populations, Galactic astronomy,
and stellar astrophysics. From among the early results of the APOGEE
project - which span from measurements of Galactic dynamics, to
multi-element chemical maps of the disk and bulge, new views of the
interstellar medium, explorations of stellar companions, the chemistry
of star clusters, and the discovery of rare stellar species - I
highlight a few results that demonstrate APOGEE's unique ability to
sample and characterize the Galactic disk and bulge. Plans are now under
way for an even more ambitious successor to APOGEE: the six-year,
dual-hemisphere APOGEE-2 project. Both phases of APOGEE feature a strong
focus on targets having asteroseismological measurements from either
Kepler or $\{$CoRoT$\}$, from which it is possible to derive relatively
precise stellar ages. The combined APOGEE and APOGEE-2 databases of
stellar chemistry, dynamics and ages constitute an unusually
comprehensive, systematic and homogeneous resource for constraining
models of Galactic evolution.

of the programs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), has now
completed its systematic, homogeneous spectroscopic survey sampling all
major populations of the Milky Way. After a three-year observing
campaign on the Sloan 2.5 m Telescope, APOGEE has collected a half
million high-resolution (R {\tilde} 22,500), high signal-to-noise ratio
($\gt$100), infrared (1.51-1.70 {$\mu$}m) spectra for 146,000 stars,
with time series information via repeat visits to most of these stars.
This paper describes the motivations for the survey and its overall
design{\mdash}hardware, field placement, target selection,
operations{\mdash}and gives an overview of these aspects as well as the
data reduction, analysis, and products. An index is also given to the
complement of technical papers that describe various critical survey
components in detail. Finally, we discuss the achieved survey
performance and illustrate the variety of potential uses of the data
products by way of a number of science demonstrations, which span from
time series analysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity
variations from stellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics,
metallicity, and abundance patterns across the Galaxy and as a function
of age, to new views of the interstellar medium, the chemistry of star
clusters, and the discovery of rare stellar species. As part of SDSS-III
Data Release 12 and later releases, all of the APOGEE data products are
publicly available.

  Abstract                 = {{We use recent observations of the evolution of the Type Ia supernova (SN
Ia) rate with redshift, the dependence of the SN Ia rate on the colours
of the parent galaxies, and the enhancement of the SN Ia rate in
radio-loud early-type galaxies to derive on robust empirical grounds,
the delay time distribution (DTD) between the formation of the
progenitor star and its explosion as an SN. Our analysis finds: (i)
delay times as long as 3-4 Gyr, derived from observations of SNe Ia at
high redshift, cannot reproduce the dependence of the SN Ia rate on the
colours and on the radio-luminosity of the parent galaxies, as observed
in the local Universe; (ii) the comparison between observed SN rates and
a grid of theoretical `single-population' DTDs shows that only a few of
them are possibly consistent with observations. The most successful
models are all predicting a peak of SN explosions soon after star
formation and an extended tail in the DTD, and can reproduce the data
but only at a modest statistical confidence level; (iii) present data
are best matched by a bimodal DTD, in which about 50 per cent of SNe Ia
(dubbed `prompt' SNe Ia) explode soon after their stellar birth, in a
time of the order of 10$^{8}$ yr, while the remaining 50 per cent
(`tardy' SNe Ia) have a much wider distribution, well described by an
exponential function with a decay time of about 3 Gyr.

The presence in the DTD of both a strong peak at early times and a
prolonged exponential tail, coupled with the well-established bimodal
distribution of the decay rate ({$\Delta$}m$_{15}$) and the
systematic difference observed in the expansion velocities of the ejecta
of SNe Ia in ellipticals and spirals, suggests the existence of two
classes of progenitors. We discuss the cosmological implications of this
result and make simple predictions, which are testable with future
instrumentation.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Rotational splittings are currently measured for several main
sequence stars and a large number of red giants with the space mission
Kepler. This will provide stringent constraints on rotation profiles.
<BR /> Aims: Our aim is to obtain seismic constraints on the internal
transport and surface loss of the angular momentum of oscillating
solar-like stars. To this end, we study the evolution of rotational
splittings from the pre-main sequence to the red-giant branch for
stochastically excited oscillation modes. <BR /> Methods: We modified
the evolutionary code CESAM2K to take rotationally induced transport in
radiative zones into account. Linear rotational splittings were computed
for a sequence of 1.3 M$_{&sun;}$ models. Rotation profiles were
derived from our evolutionary models and eigenfunctions from linear
adiabatic oscillation calculations. <BR /> Results: We find that
transport by meridional circulation and shear turbulence yields far too
high a core rotation rate for red-giant models compared with recent
seismic observations. We discuss several uncertainties in the physical
description of stars that could have an impact on the rotation profiles.
For instance, we find that the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability
does not extract enough angular momentum from the core to account for
the discrepancy. In contrast, an increase of the horizontal turbulent
viscosity by 2 orders of magnitude is able to significantly decrease the
central rotation rate on the red-giant branch. <BR /> Conclusions: Our
results indicate that it is possible that the prescription for the
horizontal turbulent viscosity largely underestimates its actual value
or else a mechanism not included in current stellar models of low mass
stars is needed to slow down the rotation in the radiative core of
red-giant stars.

at the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT), GALAH will determine stellar
parameters and abundances of up to 29 elements for up to one million
stars. Selecting targets from a colour-unbiased catalogue built from
2MASS, APASS and UCAC4 data, we expect to observe dwarfs at 0.3 to 3 kpc

inventory of the Galactic thin and thick disks, and also captures
smaller samples of the bulge and halo. In this paper we present the
plan, process and progress as of early 2016 for GALAH survey
observations. In our first two years of survey observing we have
accumulated the largest high-quality spectroscopic data set at this
resolution, over 200,000 stars. We also present the first public GALAH
data catalogue: stellar parameters (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe]),

halo with chemical abundance patterns that indicate they originally
formed in globular clusters. Using data from the Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Survey available
through Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 12, we first
identify likely halo giants, and then search those for the well-known
chemical tags associated with globular clusters, specifically enrichment
in nitrogen and aluminum. We find that 2\% of the halo giants in our
sample have this chemical signature, in agreement with previous results.
Following the interpretation in our previous work on this topic, this
would imply that at least 13\% of halo stars originally formed in
globular clusters. Recent developments in the theoretical understanding
of globular cluster formation raise questions about that interpretation,
and we concede the possibility that these migrants represent a small
fraction of the halo field. There are roughly as many stars with the
chemical tags of globular clusters in the halo field as there are in
globular clusters, whether or not they are accompanied by a much larger
chemically untaggable population of former globular cluster stars.

This is qualitatively expected from mass-dependent post-main-sequence
evolution. We here establish an empirical relation between these
quantities by drawing on 1475 red giants with asteroseismic mass
estimates from Kepler that also have spectroscopic labels from Apache
Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) DR12. We assess
the accuracy of our model, and find that it predicts stellar masses with
fractional rms errors of about 14 per cent (typically 0.2
M$_{&sun;}$). From these masses, we derive ages with rms errors of
40 per cent. This empirical model allows us for the first time to make
age determinations (in the range 1-13 Gyr) for vast numbers of giant
stars across the Galaxy. We apply our model to {\tilde}52 000 stars in
APOGEE DR12, for which no direct mass and age information was previously
available. We find that these estimates highlight the vertical age
structure of the Milky Way disc, and that the relation of age with
[{$\alpha$}/M] and metallicity is broadly consistent with established
expectations based on detailed studies of the solar neighbourhood.

history, and four with mergers in their last 9 Gyr of evolution. We
compare their structure at z = 0 by decomposing them into `mono-age
populations' (MAPs) of stars within 500 Myr age bins. All studied
galaxies undergo a phase of merging activity at high redshift, so that
stars older than 9 Gyr are found in a centrally concentrated component,
while younger stars are mostly found in discs. We find that most MAPs
have simple exponential radial and vertical density profiles, with a
scaleheight that typically increases with age. Because a large range of
merger histories can create populations with simple structures, this
suggests that the simplicity of the structure of mono-abundance
populations observed in the Milky Way by Bovy et al. is not necessarily
a direct indicator of a quiescent history for the Milky Way. Similarly,
the anticorrelation between scalelength and scaleheight does not
necessarily imply a merger-free history. However, mergers produce
discontinuities between thin and thick disc components, and jumps in the
age-velocity relation. The absence of a structural discontinuity between
thin and thick disc observed in the Milky Way would seem to be a good
indicator that no merger with a mass ratio larger than 1:15-1:10
occurred in the last 9 Gyr. Mergers at higher redshift might
nevertheless be necessary to produce the thickest, hottest components of
the Milky Way's disc.

  Abstract                 = {{We study the relation between stellar ages and vertical velocity
dispersion (the age-velocity relation, or AVR) in a sample of seven
simulated disc galaxies. In our simulations, the shape of the AVR for
stars younger than 9 Gyr depends strongly on the merger history at low
redshift, with even 1:10-1:15 mergers being able to create jumps in the
AVR (although these jumps might not be detectable if the errors on
stellar ages are of the order of 30 per cent). For galaxies with a
quiescent history at low redshift, we find that the vertical velocity
dispersion rises smoothly for ages up to 8-9 Gyr, following a power law
with a slope of {\tilde}0.5, similar to what is observed in the solar
neighbourhood by the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey. For these galaxies, we
show that the slope of the AVR is not imprinted at birth, but is the
result of subsequent heating. By contrast, in all our simulations, the
oldest stars form a significantly different population, with a high
velocity dispersion. These stars are usually born kinematically hot in a
turbulent phase of intense mergers at high redshift, and also include
some stars accreted from satellites. This maximum in {$\sigma$}$_{z}$
is strongly decreased when age errors are included, suggesting that
observations can easily miss such a jump with the current accuracy of
age measurements.

  Abstract                 = {{Bars are strong drivers of secular evolution in disk galaxies. Bars
themselves can evolve secularly through angular momentum transport,
producing different boxy/peanut and X-shaped bulges. Our Milky Way is an
example of a barred galaxy with a boxy bulge. We present a
self-consistent N-body simulation of a barred galaxy which matches
remarkably well the structure of the inner Milky Way deduced from star
counts. In particular, features taken as signatures of a second ``long
bar`` can be explained by the interaction between the bar and the spiral
arms of the galaxy (Martinez-Valpuesta {\amp} Gerhard 2011). Furthermore
the structural change in the bulge inside l = 4{\deg} measured recently
from VVV data can be explained by the high-density near-axisymmetric
part of the inner boxy bulge (Gerhard {\amp} Martinez-Valpuesta 2012). We
also compare this model with kinematic data from recent spectroscopic
surveys. We use a modified version of the NMAGIC code (de Lorenzi et al.
2007) to study the properties of the Milky Way bar, obtaining an upper
limit for the pattern speed of \~{} 42 km/sec/kpc. See Fig. 1 for a
comparison of one of our best models with BRAVA data (Kunder et al.

  Abstract                 = {{We present rotational and radial velocities for a sample of 761 giants
selected from the Hipparcos Catalogue to lie within 100 pc of the Sun.
Our original goal was to examine stellar rotation in field giants using
spectroscopic line broadening to look for evidence of excess rotation
that could be attributed to planets that were engulfed as the parent
stars expanded. Thus we were obliged to investigate other sources of
line broadening, including tidal coupling in close binaries and
macroturbulence. For all the binaries in our sample with periods shorter
than 20 days the orbits have been circularized, while about half the
orbits with periods in the range 20-100 days still show significant
eccentricity. All our primaries in orbits shorter than 30 days show line
broadening consistent with synchronized rotation, while about half the
primaries with periods in the range 30-120 days are synchronized. To
study the dependence of rotation on stellar evolution when tidal effects
are not important, we used a subsample of single stars and members in
wide binaries. We found evidence to suggest that the first dredge-up may
play a role in speeding up the rotation of the observable outer layers
of giants and that the rotational velocity of horizontal branch stars is
larger by a few km s$^{-1}$ than that of first-ascent giants with
similar mass, effective temperature, and radius. Finally, we found three
giants that rotate more rapidly than expected. We conjecture that they
acquired their excess angular momentum by ingesting planets.

Some of the results presented here used observations made with the
Multiple Mirror Telescope, a joint facility of the Smithsonian
Institution and the University of Arizona.

to hot plasma rising to the photosphere where it cools down and descends
back into the interior at the edges of granules. This is the visible
manifestation of convection taking place in the outer part of the solar
convection zone. Because red giants have deeper convection zones than
the Sun, we cannot a priori assume that their granulation is a scaled
version of solar granulation. Until now, neither observations nor
one-dimensional analytical convection models could put constraints on
granulation in red giants. With asteroseismology, this study can now be
performed. We analyze \~{}1000 red giants that have been observed by Kepler
during 13 months. We fit the power spectra with Harvey-like profiles to
retrieve the characteristics of the granulation (timescale
{$\tau$}$_{gran}$ and power P $_{gran}$). We search for a
correlation between these parameters and the global acoustic-mode
parameter (the position of maximum power, {$\nu$}$_{max}$) as well as
with stellar parameters (mass, radius, surface gravity (log g), and
effective temperature (T $_{eff}$)). We show that
{$\tau$}$_{eff}$vprop{$\nu$}$^{-0.89}$ $_{max}$ and P
$_{gran}$vprop{$\nu$}$^{-1.90}$ $_{max}$, which is
consistent with the theoretical predictions. We find that the
granulation timescales of stars that belong to the red clump have
similar values while the timescales of stars in the red giant branch are
spread in a wider range. Finally, we show that realistic
three-dimensional simulations of the surface convection in stars,
spanning the (T $_{eff}$, log g) range of our sample of red
giants, match the Kepler observations well in terms of trends.

an improved characterization of exoplanets and their host stars, but
also a new window on stellar structure and evolution for the large
sample of solar-type stars in the field. We perform a uniform analysis
of 22 of the brightest asteroseismic targets with the highest
signal-to-noise ratio observed for 1 month each during the first year of
the mission, and we quantify the precision and relative accuracy of
asteroseismic determinations of the stellar radius, mass, and age that
are possible using various methods. We present the properties of each
star in the sample derived from an automated analysis of the individual
oscillation frequencies and other observational constraints using the
Asteroseismic Modeling Portal (AMP), and we compare them to the results
of model-grid-based methods that fit the global oscillation properties.
We find that fitting the individual frequencies typically yields
asteroseismic radii and masses to \~{}1\% precision, and ages to \~{}2.5\%
precision (respectively, 2, 5, and 8 times better than fitting the
global oscillation properties). The absolute level of agreement between
the results from different approaches is also encouraging, with
model-grid-based methods yielding slightly smaller estimates of the
radius and mass and slightly older values for the stellar age relative
to AMP, which computes a large number of dedicated models for each star.
The sample of targets for which this type of analysis is possible will
grow as longer data sets are obtained during the remainder of the
mission.

  Abstract                 = {{Metal-poor stars trace the earliest phases in the chemical enrichment of
the Universe. They give clues about the early assembly of the Galaxy as
well as on the nature of the first stellar generations. Multi-object
spectroscopic surveys play a key role in finding these fossil records in
large volumes. Here we present a novel analysis of the metal-poor star
sample in the complete Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Data Release 5
catalog with the goal of identifying and characterizing all very
metal-poor stars observed by the survey. Using a three-stage method, we
first identified the candidate stars using only their spectra as input
information. We employed an algorithm called t-SNE to construct a
low-dimensional projection of the spectrum space and isolate the region
containing metal-poor stars. Following this step, we measured the
equivalent widths of the near-infrared Ca ii triplet lines with a method
based on flexible Gaussian processes to model the correlated noise
present in the spectra. In the last step, we constructed a calibration
relation that converts the measured equivalent widths and the color
information coming from the 2MASS and WISE surveys into metallicity and
temperature estimates. We identified 877 stars with at least a 50\%
probability of being very metal-poor ([Fe/H] $\lt$ -2 dex), out of which
43 are likely extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H] $\lt$ -3 dex). The comparison
of the derived values to a small subsample of stars with literature
metallicity values shows that our method works reliably and correctly
estimates the uncertainties, which typically have
values{$\sigma$}$_{[Fe/H]}$ {\ap} 0.2 dex. In addition, when compared
to the metallicity results derived using the RAVE DR5 pipeline, it is
evident that we achieve better accuracy than the pipeline and therefore
more reliably evaluate the very metal-poor subsample. Based on the
repeated observations of the same stars, our method gives very
consistent results. We intend to study the identified sample further by
acquiring high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up observations. The
method used in this work can also easily be extended to other
large-scale data sets, including to the data from the Gaia mission and
the upcoming 4MOST survey.

spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way that has already obtained over
half a million stellar spectra. They present a randomly selected
magnitude-limited sample, so it is important to use a reliable and
automated classification scheme that identifies normal single stars and
discovers different types of peculiar stars. To this end, we present a
morphological classification of \~{}350, 000 RAVE survey stellar spectra
using locally linear embedding, a dimensionality reduction method that
enables representing the complex spectral morphology in a
low-dimensional projected space while still preserving the properties of
the local neighborhoods of spectra. We find that the majority of all
spectra in the database (\~{} 90\%-95\%) belong to normal single stars, but
there is also a significant population of several types of peculiars.
Among them, the most populated groups are those of various types of
spectroscopic binary and chromospherically active stars. Both of them
include several thousands of spectra. Particularly the latter group
offers significant further investigation opportunities since activity of
stars is a known proxy of stellar ages. Applying the same classification
procedure to the sample of normal single stars alone shows that the
shape of the projected manifold in two-dimensional space correlates with
stellar temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity.

population because their distances and ages can be determined from their
period-luminosity and period-age relations. In addition, the radial

structure and evolution of the Galaxy. Here, we report the radial
velocities of classical Cepheids near the Galactic center, three of
which were reported in 2011 and a fourth being reported for the first
time. The velocities of these Cepheids suggest that the stars orbit
within the nuclear stellar disk, a group of stars and interstellar
matter occupying a region of \~{}200 pc around the center, although the
three-dimensional velocities cannot be determined until the proper
motions are known. According to our simulation, these four Cepheids
formed within the nuclear stellar disk like younger stars and stellar
clusters therein.

most recent ideas on stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova (SN)
progenitors are taken into account. It is assumed that the disk forms by
accretion of primordial material coming from outside with a time-scale
which is a function of the galactocentric distance. The possibility of
forming the disk out of enriched halo gas is also studied in a simple
way. The evolution of the abundances of several single elements is
predicted as well as that of gas mass, SN rates and star formation rate,
both in the solar neighborhood and in the whole disk, under different
assumptions for the star formation rate. Abundance gradients along the
galactic disk are well reproduced and a possible interpretation for the
differences among gradients of different elements is given in terms of
nucleosynthesis and stellar lifetimes. This interpretation can represent
a key for understanding gradients also in external galaxies. In
particular, a natural explanation is suggested for the positive gradient
of S/O, found in M101 and M33.

formation histories in galaxies by adopting the most popular and recent
progenitor models. We show that the timescale for the maximum in the SN
Ia rate, which corresponds also to time of the maximum enrichment, is
not unique but is a strong function of the adopted stellar lifetimes,
initial mass function, and star formation rate. This timescale varies
from \~{}40-50 Myr for an instantaneous starburst to \~{}0.3 Gyr for a typical
elliptical galaxy to \~{}4.0-5.0 Gyr for a disk of a spiral galaxy like the
Milky Way. We also show that the typical timescale of 1 Gyr, often
quoted as the typical timescale for the SNe Ia, is just the time at
which, in the solar neighborhood, the Fe production from SNe Ia starts
to become important and not the time at which SNe Ia start to explode.
As a consequence of this, a change in slope in the [O/Fe] ratio is
expected in correspondence of this timescale. We conclude that the
suggested lack of SNe Ia at low metallicities produces results at
variance with the observed [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relation in the solar
region. We also compute the SN Ia rates for different galaxies as a
function of redshift and predict an extended maximum between redshift
z\~{}3.6 and z\~{}1.6 for elliptical galaxies, and two maxima, one at z\~{}3 and
the other at z\~{}1, for spiral galaxies, under the assumption that
galaxies start forming stars at z$_{f}$\~{}5 and

that the D astration should be maximum due to the high star formation
rate required for the bulge whereas the evolution of the abundance of Li
should be similar to that observed in the solar neighbourhood, but with
an higher Li abundance in the interstellar medium at the present time.

present results for the chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge by
assuming that this central region evolved even faster than the Galactic
halo. This assumption is required in order to reproduce the observed
metallicity distribution of bulge stars as obtained by McWilliam {\amp}
Rich (1994). The model is similar to that adopted by Matteucci and
Brocato (1990) with the exception that we have adopted the most recent
nucleosynthesis prescriptions for either low-intermediate mass stars or
massive stars and extended our predictions to most of the alpha
-elements, Fe, C, N and light elements (D, (7) Li). We have tested the
effect of changing the slope of the IMF on the predicted stellar
metallicity distribution for bulge stars and have compared our results
with the distribution obtained from the most recent data. An initial
mass function (IMF) favoring the formation of massive stars with respect
to the solar vicinity improves the agreement with observations. Then,
using our best model, we have made some predictions about temporal
evolution of light and heavy species in the Galactic bulge. In
particular, we predict that alpha -elements should be enhanced relative
to Fe for most of the metallicity range, although different alpha
-elements should show a different degree of enhancement due to the
particular nucleosynthetic history of each element. The enhancements are
larger than predicted for the halo and thick-disk stars because of the
flatter IMF assumed for the bulge. We predict that deuterium, due to the
intense star formation occurred in bulge, should be completely depleted
whereas (7) Li should show a trend similar to that found for the solar
neighbourhood. We also compared the Li abundance recently measured in
one bulge star (Minniti et al., 1998) and concluded that it is very
likely that the Li in the star must have been depleted and therefore it
does not reflect the Li abundance of the gas out of which the star
formed. In the opposite case, one should completely suppress one of the
main stellar sources of Li in order to reconcile the model with the
observed value.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. The mean density of a star transited by a planet, brown dwarf
or low mass star can be accurately measured from its light curve. This
measurement can be combined with other observations to estimate its mass
and age by comparison with stellar models. <BR /> Aims: Our aim is to
calculate the posterior probability distributions for the mass and age
of a star given its density, effective temperature, metallicity and
luminosity. <BR /> Methods: We computed a large grid of stellar models
that densely sample the appropriate mass and metallicity range. The
posterior probability distributions are calculated using a Markov-chain
Monte-Carlo method. The method has been validated by comparison to the
results of other stellar models and by applying the method to stars in
eclipsing binary systems with accurately measured masses and radii. We
have explored the sensitivity of our results to the assumed values of
the mixing-length parameter, {$\alpha$}$_{MLT}$, and initial helium
mass fraction, Y. <BR /> Results: For a star with a mass of 0.9
M$_{&sun;}$ and an age of 4 Gyr our method recovers the mass of
the star with a precision of 2\% and the age to within 25\% based on the
density, effective temperature and metallicity predicted by a range of
different stellar models. The masses of stars in eclipsing binaries are
recovered to within the calculated uncertainties (typically 5\%) in about
90\% of cases. There is a tendency for the masses to be underestimated by
about 0.1 M$_{&sun;}$ for some stars with rotation periods
P$_{rot}$$\lt$ 7 d. <BR /> Conclusions: Our method makes it
straightforward to determine accurately the joint posterior probability
distribution for the mass and age of a star eclipsed by a planet or
other dark body based on its observed properties and a state-of-the art
set of stellar models.

accurate than either determination in isolation - uncertainties are on
average two times smaller than for RAVE-only distances (three times
smaller for dwarfs), and 1.4 times smaller than TGAS parallax
uncertainties (two times smaller for giants). We are also able to
compare the estimates from spectrophotometry to those from Gaia, and use
this to assess the reliability of both catalogues and improve our
distance estimates. We find that the distances to the lowest log g stars
are, on average, overestimated and caution that they may not be
reliable. We also find that it is likely that the Gaia random
uncertainties are smaller than the reported values. As a byproduct we
derive ages for the RAVE stars, many with relative uncertainties less
than 20 percent. These results for 219566 RAVE sources have been made
publicly available, and we encourage their use for studies that combine
the radial velocities provided by RAVE with the proper motions provided
by Gaia. A sample that we believe to be reliable can be found by taking

  Abstract                 = {{The average bulge [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are +0.06 and +0.17 dex,
respectively, in Baade's Window, roughly 0.2 dex higher than the thin
disk and \~{}0.7 dex higher than the local thick disk metallicity. This
suggests a higher effective yield in the bulge, perhaps due to more
efficient retention of supernova ejecta. The bulge vertical [Fe/H]
gradient, at \~{}0.5 dex/kpc, appears to be due to a changing mixture of
sub-populations (near +0.3 dex and -0.3 dex and one possibly near -0.7
dex) with latitude. The bulge is enhanced in O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, and Al
relative to the sun, with [alpha/Fe]=+0.15 dex at [Fe/H]=0.0 dex. Below
[Fe/H]\~{}-0.5 dex, the bulge and local thick disk compositions are very
similar, but small [Mg/Fe] and possibly [$\lt$SiCaTi$\gt$/Fe]
enhancements, low [La/Eu] ratios and large [Cu/Fe], relative to the
thick disk suggest slightly higher SFR in the bulge. However, these
composition differences could simply be due to measurement errors and
non-LTE effects. Unfortunately, comparison with the thick disk near
solar [Fe/H] suffers considerable confusion, due to poor identification
of the local thick disk. Unusual zig-zag abundance trends of [Cu/Fe] and
[Na/Fe] suggest nucleosynthesis dominated by core-collapse supernovae
with metallicity-dependent yields, in the Type\~{}Ia supernova time-delay
scenario. Thus, the bulge sub-population compositions resemble the local
thin and thick disks, but at higher [Fe/H], suggesting a radial [Fe/H]
gradient in both the thin and thick disks, within the solar circle, near
-0.04 to -0.05 dex/kpc. If the bulge was built through accretion of
inner disk stars by a bar, it appears that the inner thin and thick disk
stars, incorporated into the bulge, retained vertical scale heights
characteristic of their kinematic origin, and resulting in the vertical
[Fe/H] gradient and [alpha/Fe] trends seen today.

the first time in a consistent way. We find that Mg and Al drive the
population membership in most clusters, except in M107 and M71, the two
most metal-rich clusters in our study, where the grouping is most
sensitive to N. We also find a diversity in the abundance distributions,
with some clusters exhibiting clear abundance bimodalities (for example
M3 and M53) while others show extended distributions. The spread of Al
abundances increases significantly as cluster average metallicity
decreases as previously found by other works, which we take as evidence
that low metallicity, intermediate mass AGB polluters were more common
in the more metal poor clusters. The statistically significant
correlation of [Al/Fe] with [Si/Fe] in M15 suggests that \$\^{}$\{$28$\}$\$Si
leakage has occurred in this cluster. We also present C, N and O
abundances for stars cooler than 4500 K and examine the behavior of
A(C+N+O) in each cluster as a function of temperature and [Al/Fe]. The
scatter of A(C+N+O) is close to its estimated uncertainty in all
clusters and independent on stellar temperature. A(C+N+O) exhibits small
correlations and anticorrelations with [Al/Fe] in M3 and M13, but we
cannot be certain about these relations given the size of our abundance
uncertainties. Star-to-star variations of \$$\backslash$alpha-\$elements (Si, Ca, Ti)
abundances are comparable to our estimated errors in all clusters.

  Abstract                 = {{Asteroseismology of bright stars with well-determined properties from
parallax measurements and interferometry can yield precise stellar ages
and meaningful constraints on the composition. We substantiate this
claim with an updated asteroseismic analysis of the solar-analog binary
system 16 Cyg A {\amp} B using the complete 30-month data sets from the
Kepler space telescope. An analysis with the Asteroseismic Modeling
Portal (AMP), using all of the available constraints to model each star
independently, yields the same age (\$t=7.0 $\backslash$pm 0.3\$ Gyr) and composition
(\$Z=0.021 $\backslash$pm 0.002\$, \$Y\_i=0.25 $\backslash$pm 0.01\$) for both stars, as expected
for a binary system. We quantify the accuracy of the derived stellar
properties by conducting a similar analysis of a Kepler-like data set
for the Sun, and we investigate how the reliability of asteroseismic
inference changes when fewer observational constraints are available or
when different fitting methods are employed. We find that our estimates
of the initial helium mass fraction are probably biased low by 0.02-0.03
from neglecting diffusion and settling of heavy elements, and we
identify changes to our fitting method as the likely source of small
shifts from our initial results in 2012. We conclude that in the best
cases reliable stellar properties can be determined from asteroseismic
analysis even without independent constraints on the radius and
luminosity.

  Abstract                 = {{Recently the number of main-sequence and subgiant stars exhibiting
solar-like oscillations that are resolved into individual mode
frequencies has increased dramatically. While only a few such data sets
were available for detailed modeling just a decade ago, the Kepler
mission has produced suitable observations for hundreds of new targets.
This rapid expansion in observational capacity has been accompanied by a
shift in analysis and modeling strategies to yield uniform sets of
derived stellar properties more quickly and easily. We use previously
published asteroseismic and spectroscopic data sets to provide a uniform
analysis of 42 solar-type Kepler targets from the Asteroseismic Modeling
Portal. We find that fitting the individual frequencies typically
doubles the precision of the asteroseismic radius, mass, and age
compared to grid-based modeling of the global oscillation properties,
and improves the precision of the radius and mass by about a factor of
three over empirical scaling relations. We demonstrate the utility of
the derived properties with several applications.

  Abstract                 = {{Gaia's astrometric solution aims to determine at least five parameters
for each star, together with appropriate estimates of their
uncertainties and correlations. This requires at least five distinct
observations per star. In the early data reductions the number of
observations may be insufficient for a five-parameter solution, and even
after the full mission many stars will remain under-observed, including
faint stars at the detection limit and transient objects. In such cases
it is reasonable to determine only the two position parameters. Their
formal uncertainties would however grossly underestimate the actual
errors, due to the neglected parallax and proper motion. We aim to
develop a recipe to calculate sensible formal uncertainties that can be
used in all cases of under-observed stars. Prior information about the
typical ranges of stellar parallaxes and proper motions is incorporated
in the astrometric solution by means of Bayes' rule. Numerical
simulations based on the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot (GUMS) are used to
investigate how the prior influences the actual errors and formal
uncertainties when different amounts of Gaia observations are available.
We develop a criterion for the optimum choice of priors, apply it to a
wide range of cases, and derive a global approximation of the optimum
prior as a function of magnitude and galactic coordinates. The
feasibility of the Bayesian approach is demonstrated through global
astrometric solutions of simulated Gaia observations. With an
appropriate prior it is possible to derive sensible positions with
realistic error estimates for any number of available observations. Even
though this recipe works also for well-observed stars it should not be
used where a good five-parameter astrometric solution can be obtained
without a prior. Parallaxes and proper motions from a solution using
priors are always biased and should not be used.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. The first release of astrometric data from Gaia is expected in
2016. It will contain the mean stellar positions and magnitudes from the
first year of observations. For more than 100 000 stars in common with
the Hipparcos Catalogue it will be possible to compute very accurate
proper motions due to the time difference of about 24 years between the
two missions. This Hundred Thousand Proper Motions (HTPM) project is
planned to be part of the first release. <BR /> Aims: Our aim is to
investigate how early Gaia data can be optimally combined with
information from the Hipparcos Catalogue in order to provide the most
accurate and reliable results for HTPM. <BR /> Methods: The Astrometric
Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) was developed to compute the
astrometric core solution based on the Gaia observations and will be
used for all releases of astrometric data from Gaia. We adapt AGIS to
process Hipparcos data in addition to Gaia observations, and use
simulations to verify and study the joint solution method. <BR />
Results: For the HTPM stars we predict proper motion accuracies between
14 and 134 {$\mu$}as yr$^{-1}$, depending on stellar magnitude and
amount of Gaia data available. Perspective effects will be important for
a significant number of HTPM stars, and in order to treat these effects
accurately we introduce a formalism called scaled model of kinematics
(SMOK). We define a goodness-of-fit statistic which is sensitive to
deviations from uniform space motion, caused for example by binaries
with periods of 10-50 years. <BR /> Conclusions: HTPM will significantly
improve the proper motions of the Hipparcos Catalogue well before highly
accurate Gaia-only results become available. Also, HTPM will allow us to
detect long period binary and exoplanetary candidates which would be
impossible to detect from Gaia data alone. The full sensitivity will not
be reached with the first Gaia release but with subsequent data
releases. Therefore HTPM should be repeated when more Gaia data become
available.

  Abstract                 = {{Undoubtedly one the highlights of the Kepler asteroseismology programme
has been the detection of solar-like oscillations in giants belonging to
the open clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6819, and NGC 6811. The availability of
such constraints has made it possible to infer precise stellar
properties (e.g. radius, mass, evolutionary state, age) on a
star-by-star basis.These constraints give us a {\ldquo}new pair of
eyes{\rdquo} to look at clusters, and they open several exciting
opportunities. Based on a detailed analysis of the complete set of
4-years-long Kepler data, we present clear evidence for stars that have
undergone non-standard evolution (evolved blue stragglers, low-mass
Li-rich stars). We then illustrate the potential of integrated-mass-loss
and mass-loss-dispersion measurements in both NGC6791 and NGC6819, which
suggest a small true mass scatter among the red-clump stars and thus a
very small mass-loss dispersion.We will then show examples of how our
analysis based on individual-mode frequencies, as opposed to average
seismic parameters and scaling relations, allow us to determine with
higher accuracy stellar properties, and to probe features in the deep
stellar interior (i.e. acoustic glitches related to Helium ionisation,
properties of near-core mixing in the He-core-burning phase).Finally, we
will discuss the prospects for seismic analyses of other clusters, in
particular the globular cluster M4 which could reveal new insights into
mass-loss dispersion and its effect on the horizontal-branch morphology.

  Abstract                 = {{Mass-loss of red giant branch (RGB) stars is still poorly determined,
despite its crucial role in the chemical enrichment of galaxies. Thanks
to the recent detection of solar-like oscillations in G-K giants in open
clusters with Kepler, we can now directly determine stellar masses for a
statistically significant sample of stars in the old open clusters NGC
6791 and 6819. The aim of this work is to constrain the integrated RGB
mass-loss by comparing the average mass of stars in the red clump (RC)
with that of stars in the low-luminosity portion of the RGB [i.e. stars
with L{\lsim}L(RC)]. Stellar masses were determined by combining the
available seismic parameters {$\nu$}$_{max}$ and {$\Delta$}{$\nu$} with
additional photometric constraints and with independent distance
estimates. We measured the masses of 40 stars on the RGB and 19 in the
RC of the old metal-rich cluster NGC 6791. We find that the difference
between the average mass of RGB and RC stars is small, but significant
[? (random) {\plusmn}0.04 (systematic) M$_{&sun;}$]. Interestingly,
such a small ? does not support scenarios of an extreme mass-loss for
this metal-rich cluster. If we describe the mass-loss rate with Reimers
prescription, a first comparison with isochrones suggests that the
observed ? is compatible with a mass-loss efficiency parameter in the
range 0.1 {\lsim}{$\eta$}{\lsim} 0.3. Less stringent constraints on the RGB
mass-loss rate are set by the analysis of the {\tilde}2 Gyr old NGC 6819,
largely due to the lower mass-loss expected for this cluster, and to the
lack of an independent and accurate distance determination. In the near
future, additional constraints from frequencies of individual pulsation
modes and spectroscopic effective temperatures will allow further
stringent tests of the {$\Delta$}{$\nu$} and {$\nu$}$_{max}$ scaling
relations, which provide a novel, and potentially very accurate, means
of determining stellar radii and masses.

independent estimates of these properties are however scarce, especially
in the metal-poor regime. Here, we report the detection of solar-like
oscillations in eight stars belonging to the red-giant branch (RGB) and
red-horizontal branch (RHB) of the globular cluster M4. The detections
were made in photometric observations from the K2 Mission during its
Campaign 2. Making use of independent constraints on the distance, we
estimate masses of the eight stars by utilizing different combinations
of seismic and non-seismic inputs. When introducing a correction to the
{$\Delta$}{$\nu$} scaling relation as suggested by stellar models, for RGB
stars we find excellent agreement with the expected masses from
isochrone fitting, and with a distance modulus derived using independent
methods. The offset with respect to independent masses is lower, or
comparable with, the uncertainties on the average RGB mass (4-10 per
cent, depending on the combination of constraints used). Our results
lend confidence to asteroseismic masses in the metal-poor regime. We
note that a larger sample will be needed to allow more stringent tests
to be made of systematic uncertainties in all the observables (both
seismic and non-seismic), and to explore the properties of RHB stars,
and of different populations in the cluster.

binary systems comprised of solar-type stars and/or red giants. This
novel method relies on the detection of the presence of two solar-like
oscillation spectra in the frequency spectrum of a single light curve.
Here, we make predictions of the numbers of systems that may be
detectable in data already collected by the NASA Kepler Mission. Our
predictions, which are based upon TRILEGAL and BiSEPS simulations of the
Kepler field of view, indicate that as many as 200 or more
''asteroseismic binaries'' may be detectable in this manner. Most of these
binaries should be comprised of two He-core-burning red giants. Owing
largely to the limited numbers of targets with the requisite
short-cadence Kepler data, we expect only a small number of detected
binaries containing solar-type stars. The predicted yield of detections
is sensitive to the assumed initial mass ratio distribution (IMRD) of
the binary components and therefore represents a sensitive calibration
of the much debated IMRD near mass ratio unity.

  Abstract                 = {{Deciphering the assembly history of the Milky Way is a formidable task,
which becomes possible only if one can produce high-resolution
chrono-chemo-kinematical maps of the Galaxy. Data from large-scale
astrometric and spectroscopic surveys will soon provide us with a
well-defined view of the current chemo-kinematical structure of the
Milky Way, but will only enable a blurred view on the temporal sequence
that led to the present-day Galaxy. As demonstrated by the (ongoing)
exploitation of data from the pioneering photometric missions CoRoT,
Kepler, and K2, asteroseismology provides the way forward: solar-like
oscillating giants are excellent evolutionary clocks thanks to the
availability of seismic constraints on their mass and to the tight
age-initial-mass relation they adhere to. In this paper we identify five
key outstanding questions relating to the formation and evolution of the
Milky Way that will need precise and accurate ages for large samples of
stars to be addressed, and we identify the requirements in terms of
number of targets and the precision on the stellar properties that are
needed to tackle such questions. By quantifying the asteroseismic yields
expected from PLATO for red-giant stars, we demonstrate that these
requirements are within the capabilities of the current instrument
design, provided that observations are sufficiently long to identify the
evolutionary state and allow robust and precise determination of
acoustic-mode frequencies. This will allow us to harvest data of
sufficient quality to reach a 10\% precision in age. This is a
fundamental pre-requisite to then reach the more ambitious goal of a
similar level of accuracy, which will only be possible if we have to
hand a careful appraisal of systematic uncertainties on age deriving
from our limited understanding of stellar physics, a goal which
conveniently falls within the main aims of PLATO's core science.

be recovered by the distribution of the observed seismic constraints:
the frequency of maximum oscillation power ({$\nu$}\_max) and the large
frequency separation ({$\Delta$}{$\nu$}). <BR />Methods: We propose to use
the observed distribution of {$\nu$}\_max and of {$\Delta$}{$\nu$} as a tool for
investigating the properties of galactic red-giant stars through
comparison with simulated distributions based on synthetic stellar
populations. <BR />Results: We can clearly identify the bulk of the red

core-He-burning stars. The distribution of {$\nu$}\_max and of {$\Delta$}{$\nu$}
gives us access to the distribution of the stellar radius and mass, and
thus represent a most promising probe of the age and star formation rate

/>Conclusions: CoRoT observations are supplying seismic constraints for
the most populated class of He-burning stars in the galactic disk. This
opens a new access gate to probing the properties of red-giant stars

knowledge of these advanced phases of stellar evolution and to add
relevant constraints to models of composite stellar populations in the

Aims: We look for the seismic signature of regions of sharp structure

Methods: We analyse the frequency dependence of the large frequency
separation and second frequency differences, as well as the behaviour of
the large frequency separation obtained with the envelope
auto-correlation function. <BR /> Results: We find evidence for a
periodic component in the oscillation frequencies, i.e. the seismic
signature of a sharp structure variation in HR 7349. In a comparison
with stellar models we interpret this feature as caused by a local
depression of the sound speed that occurs in the helium
second-ionization region. Using solely seismic constraints this allows
us to estimate the mass (M = 1.2$_{-0.4}$$^{+0.6}$ M\_{\sun})
and radius (R = 12.2$_{-1.8}$$^{+2.1}$ R\_{\sun}) of HR 7349,

reflected in the behavior of the buoyancy frequency and, therefore, in

typical of main-sequence B-type pulsating stars, the signature of a
rotationally induced mixing significantly perturbs the spectrum of

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: Until recently, most high-resolution spectroscopic studies
of the Galactic thin and thick discs were mostly confined to objects in
the solar vicinity. Here we aim at enlarging the volume in which
individual chemical abundances are used to characterise the thin and
thick discs, using the first internal data release of the Gaia-ESO
survey (GES iDR1). <BR /> Methods: We used the spectra of around 2000
FGK dwarfs and giants from the GES iDR1, obtained at resolutions of up
to R \~{} 20 000 with the FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectrograph. We derive and
discuss the abundances of eight elements (Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Cr,
Ni, and Y). <BR /> Results: We show that the trends of these elemental
abundances with iron are very similar to those in the solar
neighbourhood. We find a natural division between {$\alpha$}-rich and
{$\alpha$}-poor stars, best seen in the bimodality of the [Mg/M]
distributions in bins of metallicity, which we attribute to thick- and
thin-disc sequences, respectively. This separation is visible for most
{$\alpha$}-elements and for aluminium. With the possible exception of Al,
the observed dispersion around the trends is well described by the
expected errors, leaving little room for astrophysical dispersion. Using
previously derived distances from the first paper from this series for
our sample, we further find that the thick-disc is more extended
vertically and is more centrally concentrated towards the inner Galaxy
than the thin-disc, which indicates a shorter scale-length. We derive
the radial (4 to 12 kpc) and vertical (0 to 3.5 kpc) gradients in
metallicity, iron, four {$\alpha$}-element abundances, and aluminium for
the two populations, taking into account the identified correlation
between R$_{GC}$ and | Z |. Similarly to other works, a radial
metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. The positive radial
individual [{$\alpha$}/M] gradients found are at variance from the
gradients observed in the RAVE survey. The thin disc also hosts a
negative vertical metallicity gradient in the solar cylinder,
accompanied by positive individual [{$\alpha$}/M] and [Al/M] gradients. The
thick-disc, on the other hand, presents no radial metallicity gradient,
a shallower vertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an
{$\alpha$}-elements-to-iron radial gradient in the opposite sense than that
of the thin disc, and positive vertical individual [{$\alpha$}/M] and
[Al/M] gradients. We examine several thick-disc formation scenarii in
the light of these radial and vertical trends.

  Abstract                 = {{The main goal of Galactic Archaeology is to understand the formation and
evolution of the basic Galactic components. This requires sophisticated
chemo-dynamical modeling, where disk asymmetries (e.g., perturbations
from the bar, spirals, and mergers) and non-equilibrium processes are
taken into account self-consistently. Here we discuss the current status
of Galactic chemo-dynamical modeling and focus on a recent hybrid
technique, which helps circumvent traditional problems with chemical
enrichment and star formation encountered in fully self-consistent
cosmological simulations. We show that this model can account for a
number of chemo-kinematic relations in the Milky Way, as discussed in
previous works. In addition, we demonstrate that our model matches well
the observed age-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] relation and that blurring may be
insufficient to explain the scatter in the age-metallicity relation.

with stellar age, but age can be difficult to determine, so a proxy like
the abundance of {$\alpha$} elements (e.g., Mg) with respect to iron,
[{$\alpha$}/Fe], is used. Here we report an unexpected behavior found in
the velocity dispersion of a sample of giant stars from the Radial
Velocity Experiment survey with high-quality chemical and kinematic
information, in that it decreases strongly for stars with [Mg/Fe] {\gt}
0.4 dex (i.e., those that formed in the first gigayear of the Galaxy's
life). These findings can be explained by perturbations from massive
mergers in the early universe, which have affected the outer parts of
the disk more strongly, and the subsequent radial migration of stars
with cooler kinematics from the inner disk. Similar reversed trends in
velocity dispersion are also found for different metallicity
subpopulations. Our results suggest that the Milky Way disk merger
history can be recovered by relating the observed chemo-kinematic
relations to the properties of past merger events.

  Abstract                 = {{Recent spectroscopic observations in the Milky Way suggest that the
chemically defined thick disk (stars that have high [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios
and are thus old) has a significantly smaller scale-length than the thin
disk. This is in apparent contradiction with observations of external
edge-on galaxies, where the thin and thick components have comparable
scale-lengths. Moreover, while observed disks do not flare (scale-height
does not increase with radius), numerical simulations suggest that disk
flaring is unavoidable, resulting from both environmental effects and
secular evolution. Here we address these problems by studying two
different suites of simulated galactic disks formed in the cosmological
context. We show that the scale-heights of coeval populations always
increase with radius. However, the total population can be decomposed
morphologically into thin and thick disks, which do not flare. We relate
this to the disk inside-out formation, where younger populations have
increasingly larger scale-lengths and flare at progressively larger
radii. In this new picture, thick disks are composed of the imbedded
flares of mono-age stellar populations. Assuming that disks form inside
out, we predict that morphologically defined thick disks must show a
decrease in age (or [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios) with radius and that coeval
populations should always flare. This also explains the observed
inversion in the metallicity and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] gradients for stars away
from the disk midplane in the Milky Way. The results of this work are
directly linked to, and can be seen as evidence of, inside-out disk
growth.

  Abstract                 = {{Studying the Milky Way disk structure using stars in narrow bins of
[Fe/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] has recently been proposed as a powerful method
to understand the Galactic thick and thin disk formation. It has been
assumed so far that these mono-abundance populations (MAPs) are also
coeval, or mono-age, populations. Here we study this relationship for a
Milky Way chemodynamical model and show that equivalence between MAPs
and mono-age populations exists only for the high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] tail,
where the chemical evolution curves of different Galactic radii are far
apart. At lower [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-values an MAP is composed of stars with a
range in ages, even for small observational uncertainties and a small
MAP bin size. Due to the disk inside-out formation, for these MAPs
younger stars are typically located at larger radii, which results in
negative radial age gradients that can be as large as 2 Gyr
kpc$^{-1}$. Positive radial age gradients can result for
MAPs at the lowest [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and highest [Fe/H] end. Such variations
with age prevent the simple interpretation of observations for which
accurate ages are not available. Studying the variation with radius of
the stellar surface density and scale height in our model, we find good
agreement to recent analyses of the APOGEE red-clump (RC) sample when
1{\ndash}4 Gyr old stars dominate (as expected for the RC). Our results
suggest that the APOGEE data are consistent with a Milky Way model for
which mono-age populations flare for all ages. We propose observational
tests for the validity of our predictions and argue that using accurate
age measurements, such as from asteroseismology, is crucial for putting
constraints on Galactic formation and evolution.

chemistry are a fundamental tool for uncovering the physics driving galaxy 
formation and evolution. Observationally, these trends are derived using 
carefully selected samples isolated via the application of appropriate 
magnitude, colour, and gravity selection functions of individual stars; 
conversely, the analysis of chemodynamical simulations of galaxies has 
traditionally been restricted to the age, metallicity, and kinematics of 
'composite' stellar particles comprised of open cluster-mass simple stellar 
populations. As we enter the Gaia era, it is crucial that this approach 
changes, with simulations confronting data in a manner which better mimics the 
methodology employed by observers. Here, we use the SynCMD synthetic stellar 
populations tool to analyse the metallicity distribution function of a Milky 
Way-like simulated galaxy, employing an apparent magnitude plus gravity 
selection function similar to that employed by the RAdial Velocity Experiment 
(RAVE); we compare such an observationally-motivated approach with that 
traditionally adopted - i.e., spatial cuts alone - in order to illustrate the 
point that how one analyses a simulation can be, in some cases, just as 
important as the underlying sub-grid physics employed.

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: Using a suite of cosmological chemodynamical disc galaxy
simulations, we assess how (a) radial metallicity gradients evolve with
scaleheight; (b) the vertical metallicity gradients change through the
thick disc; and (c) the vertical gradient of the stellar rotation
velocity varies through the disc. We compare with the Milky Way to
search for analogous trends. <BR /> Methods: We analyse five simulated
spiral galaxies with masses comparable to the Milky Way. The simulations
span a range of star formation and energy feedback strengths and
prescriptions, particle- and grid-based hydrodynamical implementations,
as well as initial conditions/assembly history. Disc stars are
identified initially via kinematic decomposition, with a posteriori
spatial cuts providing the final sample from which radial and vertical
gradients are inferred. <BR /> Results: Consistently, we find that the
steeper, negative, radial metallicity gradients seen in the mid-plane
flatten with increasing height away from the plane. In simulations with
stronger (and/or more spatially-extended) feedback, the negative radial
gradients invert, becoming positive for heights in excess of \~{}1 kpc.
Such behaviour is consistent with that inferred from recent
observations. Our measurements of the vertical metallicity gradients
show no clear correlation with galactocentric radius, and are in good
agreement with those observed in the Milky Way's thick disc (locally).
Each of the simulations presents a decline in rotational velocity with
increasing height from the mid-plane, although the majority have
shallower kinematic gradients than that of the Milky Way. <BR />
Conclusions: Simulations employing stronger/more extended feedback
prescriptions possess radial and vertical metallicity and kinematic
gradients more in line with recent observations. The inverted, positive,
radial metallicity gradients seen in the simulated thick stellar discs
originate in a population of younger, more metal-rich, stars formed in
situ, superimposed upon a background population of older migrators from
the inner disc; the contrast provided by the former increases radially,
due to the inside-out growth of the disc. A similar behaviour may be
responsible for the same flattening as seen in the radial gradients with
scaleheight in the Milky Way.

will represent major milestones in the quest to chemically tag the
Galaxy. Yet this technique to reconstruct dispersed coeval stellar
groups has remained largely untested until recently. We build on
previous work that developed an empirical chemical tagging probability
function, which describes the likelihood that two field stars are
conatal, that is, they were formed in the same cluster environment. In
this work, we perform the first ever blind chemical tagging experiment,
i.e. tagging stars with no known or otherwise discernible associations,
on a sample of 714 disc field stars with a number of high-quality
high-resolution homogeneous metal abundance measurements. We present
evidence that chemical tagging of field stars does identify coeval
groups of stars, yet these groups may not represent distinct formation
sites, e.g. as in dissolved open clusters, as previously thought. Our
results point to several important conclusions, among them that group
finding will be limited strictly to chemical abundance space, e.g.
stellar ages, kinematics, colours, temperature and surface gravity do
not enhance the detectability of groups. We also demonstrate that in
addition to its role in probing the chemical enrichment and kinematic
history of the Galactic disc, chemical tagging represents a powerful new
stellar age determination technique.

the binaries have small eccentricities e {\lsim} 0.4, favor modest mass
ratios $\lt$ q$\gt$ {\ap} 0.5, and exhibit a small excess of twins q $\gt$

P (days) {\ap} 3.5 (a {\ap} 10 au), where the binaries have mass ratios
weighted toward small values q {\ap} 0.2-0.3 and follow a
Maxwellian {\ldquo}thermal{\rdquo} eccentricity distribution. Finally,
companions with long orbital periods log P (days) {\ap} 5.5-7.5 (a
{\ap} 200-5000 au) are outer tertiary components in hierarchical
triples and have a mass ratio distribution across q {\ap} 0.1-1.0
that is nearly consistent with random pairings drawn from the initial
mass function. We discuss these companion distributions and properties
in the context of binary-star formation and evolution. We also reanalyze
the binary statistics of solar-type MS primaries, taking into account
that 30\% {\plusmn} 10\% of single-lined spectroscopic binaries likely
contain white dwarf companions instead of low-mass stellar secondaries.
The mean frequency of stellar companions with q $\gt$ 0.1 and log P

solar-type MS primaries to 2.1 {\plusmn} 0.3 for O-type MS primaries. We

(CEM) applied to a wide set of theoretical galaxies with different
masses and evolutionary rates. This generalized set of models has been
computed using the so-called universal rotation curve from Persic,
Salucci {\amp} Steel to calculate the radial mass distribution of 44
theoretical protogalaxies. This distribution is a fundamental input
which, besides its own effect on the galaxy evolution, defines the
characteristic collapse time-scale or gas infall rate on to the disc. We
have adopted 10 sets of values, between 0 and 1, for the molecular cloud
and star formation efficiencies, as corresponding to their probability
nature, for each one of the radial distributions of total mass. Thus, we
have constructed a biparametric grid of models, depending on those
efficiency sets and on the rotation velocity, whose results are valid in
principle for any spiral or irregular galaxy. The model results provide
the time-evolution of different regions of the disc and the halo along
galactocentric distance, measured by the gas (atomic and molecular) and
stellar masses, the star formation rate (SFR) and chemical abundances of
14 elements, for a total of 440 models. This grid may be used to
estimate the evolution of a given galaxy for which only present time
information, such as radial distributions of elemental abundances, gas
densities and/or star formation, which are the usual observational
constraints of chemical evolution models (CEMs), is available.

elemental abundances in the disks of galaxies is analyzed; in
particular, we investigate whether they become flatter, steeper, or
remain equal with time. In order to do this, observational data related
to elemental abundances and metallicity estimates are briefly reviewed.
Most of them refer to our Galaxy, but when possible, other spiral
galaxies' data have been included. We show how the traditional view of
steeper abundance gradients at later times may be questionable and how
recent observational data sets are not in contradiction with the
opposite behavior.

Theoretical trends are deduced from the application of the multiphase
model of chemical evolution, developed by Ferrini and collaborators and
successfully used to describe the galactic components and different
morphological type galaxies. In particular, we analyze the time
evolution of the main properties of the following spiral galaxies: NGC
224, NGC 300, NGC 598, NGC 628, NGC 3198, NGC 6946, and the Milky Way.

We show that the radial distributions of elemental abundances may
flatten with time if we assume isolated galaxy evolution. The rate for
local metallicity enrichment varies with the galactocentric radius and
the morphological type, being higher for the central regions and more
intense for the early types. The flattening rate of abundance
distributions is larger for these types of galaxies, while in the latest
types the radial gradient remains almost constant with time.

populations for a wide range of ages and metallicities. The models are
based on the Padova isochrones. The core of the spectral library is
provided by the medium resolution Lejeune et al. atmosphere models.
These spectra are complemented by Non Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium
(NLTE) atmosphere models for hot stars that have an important impact on
the stellar cluster's ionizing spectra: O, B and WR stellar spectra at
the early ages, and spectra of post asymptotic giant branch stars and
planetary nebulae, at intermediate and old ages. At young ages, our
models compare well with other existing models, but we find that the
inclusion of the nebular continuum, not considered in several other
models, significantly reddens the integrated colours of very young
stellar populations. This is consistent with the results of spectral
synthesis codes particularly devised for the study of starburst
galaxies. At intermediate and old ages, the agreement with the
literature model is good and, in particular, we reproduce the observed
colours of star clusters in Large Magellanic Cloud well. Given the
ability to produce good integrated spectra from the far-ultraviolet to
the infrared at any age, we consider that our models are particularly
suited for the study of high-redshift galaxies. These models are

al. showed previously that multiphase chemical evolution models for the
three Virgo Cluster galaxies NGC 4303, 4321, and 4535, were able to
reproduce the observed radial distributions of spectral indices
Mg$_{2}$ and Fe52. Chemical evolution models may, however, fit the
present-epoch radial distributions with different star formation
histories; thus we need to include time-dependent constraints in the
problem. The two spectral indices above depend on the time-averaged
history of star formation, but they are in turn affected by the
well-known age-metallicity degeneracy, which prevents the disentangling
of age and metallicity for stellar populations, another uniqueness
problem we also discuss. Our aim is to determine whether the possible
input parameters may be strongly constrained when both radial
distributions (nebular and stellar) are used. In order to accomplish
this, we run a large number of models (500) for NGC 4303, varying the
input parameters. Less than 4\% of the models (19) fit the present-day
observational data within a region of 95\% probability. The number of
models reduces to \~{}1\% (6) when we also ask them to reproduce the
time-averaged abundances represented by the spectral indices. Thus, by
demonstrating that only a small fraction of the models are favored in
reproducing the present-day radial abundance distributions and the
spectral indices data simultaneously, we show that these spectral
indices provide strong time-dependent additional constraints on the
possible star formation and chemical histories of spiral disks.

disk is a time average over the history of the galaxy weighted by the
star formation rate, these constraints complement the information on
chemical gradients provided by the study of H II regions, which by
themselves can only provide the {$\alpha$}-element abundance accumulated
over the life of the galaxy. The agreement between the observations and
the model predictions shown here lends confidence to the models, which

  Abstract                 = {{The main objective of this work is to check if the star formation
efficiency plays a relevant role in the evolution of the relative
abundance N/O. In order to explore this idea, we analyse the evolution
of the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio as predicted by a set of computed
theoretical models. These models consist of simulated galaxies with
different total masses which are evolved assuming different collapse
time-scales and different star formation efficiencies. The combinations
of these two parameters produce different star formation histories,
which in turn have, as we show, an important impact on the resulting N/O
ratio. Since we want to check the effect of variations in these
efficiencies on our model results, the same stellar yield sets are used
for all of them. The selected yields have an important primary nitrogen
contribution coming from low- and intermediate-mass stars, which implies
that N is ejected with a certain delay with respect to O. It allows us
to obtain, as we demonstrate, a dispersion of results in the N/O-O/H
plane when star formation efficiencies vary which is in general
agreement with observations. The model results for the N/O abundance
ratio are in good agreement with most observational data trends. In
particular, the behaviour shown by the extragalactic HII regions is well
reproduced with present-time resulting abundances. Furthermore, the low
N/O values estimated for high-redshift objects, such as those obtained
for damped Lyman {$\alpha$} galaxies, as well as the higher (and constant)
values of N/O observed for irregular and dwarf galaxies or halo stars,
can be simultaneously obtained with our models at the same low oxygen
abundances 12 + log(O/H) \~{} 7. We therefore conclude that, even though
there seems to be a general belief that abundance ratios depend mostly
on stellar yields, these are not the only parameter at work when both
elements are ejected by stars of different mass ranges, and that
differences in the star formation history of galaxies and regions within
them are a key factor to explain the data in the N/O-O/H plane.

CCD cameras over the past 10 years allowed to obtain a complete census
of the stellar population in clusters down to the substellar limit. The
high efficiency of the cameras combined to their large FOV enable the
survey of several hundreds to thousands cluster members in a limited
amount of time, allowing in addition the study of their proper motion
and variability.In this contribution I first present recent results on
the low mass part of the mass function in open clusters, and discuss
whether it depends on local conditions and how it evolves with age. In a
second part, I present results obtained by the Monitor project, an
unprecedented large scale, high cadence, photometric monitoring survey
of young open clusters ideally suited to measure stellar rotation
periods and constrain angular momentum evolution models.

18 systems concentrated in a radius of {\ap}35 arcmin, i.e. 1 pc at the
cluster distance of 97 pc. No other members have been found up to 1.5
degrees from the cluster centre. The cluster mass function is consistent
with the IMF of other rich young open clusters in the higher mass range
but shows a clear deficit of low mass stars and brown dwarfs with no
objects below 0.1 M$_{&sun;}$. <BR />Aims: The aim of this paper
is to test whether this peculiar mass function could result from
dynamical evolution despite the young age of the cluster. <BR
/>Methods: We performed N-body numerical calculations starting with a
log-normal IMF and different initial conditions in terms of number of
systems and cluster radius using the code NBODY3. We simulated the
cluster dynamical evolution over 10 Myr and compared the results to the
observations. <BR />Results: We found that it is possible to reproduce
{$\eta$} Cha when starting with a very compact configuration (with
N\_init=40 and R\_0=0.005 pc) which suggests that the IMF of the
association might not be abnormal. The high initial density might also
explain the deficit of wide binaries that is observed in the cluster.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. The CoRoT mission has provided thousands of red-giant light
curves. The analysis of their solar-like oscillations allows us to
characterize their stellar properties. <BR /> Aims: Up to now, the
global seismic parameters of the pressure modes have been unable to
distinguish red-clump giants from members of the red-giant branch. As
recently done with Kepler red giants, we intend to analyze and use the
so-called mixed modes to determine the evolutionary status of the red
giants observed with CoRoT. We also aim at deriving different seismic
characteristics depending on evolution. <BR /> Methods: The complete
identification of the pressure eigenmodes provided by the red-giant
universal oscillation pattern allows us to aim at the mixed modes
surrounding the {\ell} = 1 expected eigenfrequencies. A dedicated method
based on the envelope autocorrelation function is proposed to analyze
their period separation. <BR /> Results: We have identified the
mixed-mode signature separation thanks to their pattern that is
compatible with the asymptotic law of gravity modes. We have shown that,
independent of any modeling, the g-mode spacings help to distinguish the
evolutionary status of a red-giant star. We then report the different
seismic and fundamental properties of the stars, depending on their
evolutionary status. In particular, we show that high-mass stars of the
secondary clump present very specific seismic properties. We emphasize
that stars belonging to the clump were affected by significant mass
loss. We also note significant population and/or evolution differences
in the different fields observed by CoRoT.

measured the asymptotic period spacing for 1178 stars at various

independently of evolution models. The quantitative seismic information
can now be used for stellar modeling, especially for studying the energy
transport in the helium-burning core or for specifying the inner

Modeling will also allow us to study stars that are identified to be in
the helium-subflash stage, high-mass stars either arriving or quitting

  Abstract                 = {{Context. The space mission Kepler provides us with long and
uninterrupted photometric time series of red giants. This allows us to
examine their seismic global properties and to compare these with
theoretical predictions. <BR /> Aims: We aim to describe the oscillation
power excess observed in red giant oscillation spectra with global
seismic parameters, and to investigate empirical scaling relations
governing these parameters. From these scalings relations, we derive new
physical properties of red giant oscillations. <BR /> Methods: Various
different methods were compared in order to validate the processes and
to derive reliable output values. For consistency, a single method was
then used to determine scaling relations for the relevant global
asteroseismic parameters: mean mode height, mean height of the
background signal superimposed on the oscillation power excess, width of
the power excess, bolometric amplitude of the radial modes and
visibility of non-radial modes. A method for deriving oscillation
amplitudes is proposed, which relies on the complete identification of
the red giant oscillation spectrum. <BR /> Results: The comparison of
the different methods has shown the important role of the way the
background is modelled. The convergence reached by the collaborative
work enables us to derive significant results concerning the oscillation
power excess. We obtain several scaling relations, and identify the
influence of the stellar mass and the evolutionary status. The effect of
helium burning on the red giant interior structure is confirmed: it
yields a strong mass-radius relation for clump stars. We find that none
of the amplitude scaling relations motivated by physical considerations
predict the observed mode amplitudes of red giant stars. In parallel,
the degree-dependent mode visibility exhibits important variations. Both
effects seem related to the significant influence of the high mode mass
of non-radial mixed modes. A family of red giants with very weak dipole
modes is identified, and its properties are analyzed. <BR />
Conclusions: The clear correlation between the power densities of the
background signal and of the stellar oscillation induces important
consequences to be considered for deriving a reliable theoretical
relation of the mode amplitude. As a by-product of this work, we have
verified that red giant asteroseismology delivers new insights for
stellar and Galactic physics, given the evidence for mass loss at the
tip of the red giant branch.

rotational splittings in red giants and to derive scaling relations for
rotation related to seismic and fundamental stellar parameters. <BR />
Methods: We have developed a dedicated method for automated measurements
of the rotational splittings in a large number of red giants. Ensemble
asteroseismology, namely the examination of a large number of red giants
at different stages of their evolution, allows us to derive global
information on stellar evolution. <BR /> Results: We have measured
rotational splittings in a sample of about 300 red giants. We have also
shown that these splittings are dominated by the core rotation. Under
the assumption that a linear analysis can provide the rotational
splitting, we observe a small increase of the core rotation of stars
ascending the red giant branch. Alternatively, an important slow down is
observed for red-clump stars compared to the red giant branch. We also
show that, at fixed stellar radius, the specific angular momentum
increases with increasing stellar mass. <BR /> Conclusions: Ensemble
asteroseismology indicates what has been indirectly suspected for a
while: our interpretation of the observed rotational splittings leads to
the conclusion that the mean core rotation significantly slows down
during the red giant phase. The slow-down occurs in the last stages of
the red giant branch. This spinning down explains, for instance, the
long rotation periods measured in white dwarfs.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. There are now more than 22 months of long-cadence data
available for thousands of red giants observed with the Kepler space
mission. Consequently, we are able to clearly resolve fine details in
their oscillation spectra and see many components of the mixed modes
that probe the stellar core. <BR /> Aims: We report for the first time a
parametric fit to the pattern of the {\ell} = 1 mixed modes in red
giants, which is a powerful tool to identify gravity-dominated mixed
modes. With these modes, which share the characteristics of pressure and
gravity modes, we are able to probe directly the helium core and the
surrounding shell where hydrogen is burning. <BR /> Methods: We propose
two ways for describing the so-called mode bumping that affects the
frequencies of the mixed modes. Firstly, a phenomenological approach is
used to describe the main features of the mode bumping. Alternatively, a
quasi-asymptotic mixed-mode relation provides a powerful link between
seismic observations and the stellar interior structure. We used period
{\'e}chelle diagrams to emphasize the detection of the
gravity-dominated mixed modes. <BR /> Results: The asymptotic relation
for mixed modes is confirmed. It allows us to measure the gravity-mode
period spacings in more than two hundred red giant stars. The
identification of the gravity-dominated mixed modes allows us to
complete the identification of all major peaks in a red giant
oscillation spectrum, with significant consequences for the true
identification of {\ell} = 3 modes, of {\ell} = 2 mixed modes, for the
mode widths and amplitudes, and for the {\ell} = 1 rotational splittings.
<BR /> Conclusions: The accurate measurement of the gravity-mode period
spacing provides an effective probe of the inner, g-mode cavity. The
derived value of the coupling coefficient between the cavities is
different for red giant branch and clump stars. This provides a probe of
the hydrogen-shell burning region that surrounds the helium core. Core
contraction as red giants ascend the red giant branch can be explored
using the variation of the gravity-mode spacing as a function of the
mean large separation.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. With the space-borne missions CoRoT and Kepler, a large amount
of asteroseismic data is now available and has led to a variety of work.
So-called global oscillation parameters are inferred to characterize the
large sets of stars, perform ensemble asteroseismology, and derive
scaling relations. The mean large separation is such a key parameter,
easily deduced from the radial-frequency differences in the observed
oscillation spectrum and closely related to the mean stellar density. It
is therefore crucial to measure it with the highest accuracy in order to
obtain the most precise asteroseismic indices. <BR /> Aims: As the
conditions of measurement of the large separation do not coincide with
its theoretical definition, we revisit the asymptotic expressions used
for analyzing the observed oscillation spectra. Then, we examine the
consequence of the difference between the observed and asymptotic values
of the mean large separation. <BR /> Methods: The analysis is focused on
radial modes. We use series of radial-mode frequencies in published
analyses of stars with solar-like oscillations to compare the asymptotic
and observational values of the large separation. This comparison relies
on the proper use of the second-order asymptotic expansion. <BR />
Results: We propose a simple formulation to correct the observed value
of the large separation and then derive its asymptotic counterpart. The
measurement of the curvature of the radial ridges in the {\'e}chelle
diagram provides the correcting factor. We prove that, apart from
glitches due to stellar structure discontinuities, the asymptotic
expansion is valid from main-sequence stars to red giants. Our model
shows that the asymptotic offset is close to 1/4, as in the theoretical
development, for low-mass, main-sequence stars, subgiants and red
giants. <BR /> Conclusions: High-quality solar-like oscillation spectra
derived from precise photometric measurements are definitely better
described with the second-order asymptotic expansion. The second-order
term is responsible for the curvature observed in the {\'e}chelle
diagrams used for analyzing the oscillation spectra, and this curvature
is responsible for the difference between the observed and asymptotic
values of the large separation. Taking it into account yields a revision
of the scaling relations, which provides more accurate asteroseismic
estimates of the stellar mass and radius. After correction of the bias
(6\% for the stellar radius and 3\% for the mass), the performance of the
calibrated relation is about 4\% and 8\% for estimating, respectively, the
stellar radius and the stellar mass for masses less than 1.3
M$_{&sun;}$; the accuracy is twice as bad for higher mass stars
and red giants.

  Abstract                 = {{A three-dimensional, hydrodynamical, N-body model for the formation of
the Galaxy is presented, with special attention paid to the formation of
the bulge component. Since none of the previous numerical models for the
Galaxy's formation have a proper treatment of the chemical evolution
and/or sufficient spatial resolutions, we have constructed a detailed
model of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galaxy using our
GRAPE smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code. Our SPH code includes
various physical processes related to the formation of stellar systems.
Starting with cosmologically motivated initial conditions, we obtain a
stellar system qualitatively similar to the Galaxy. Then we analyze the
chemical and kinematic properties of the bulge stars in our model and
find qualitative agreement with observational data. The early evolution
of our model has revealed that most bulge stars form during the
subgalactic merger (merger component of the bulge stars). Because of the
strong starburst induced by the merger, the metallicity distribution
function of such stars becomes as wide as observed. We find that another
group of the bulge stars forms later in the inner region of the disk
(nonmerger component of the bulge stars). Because of the difference in
the formation epoch, the main source of iron for this group of stars is
different from that for the merger component. Iron in the merger and
nonmerger components comes mainly from Type II and Type Ia supernovae,
respectively. Since a Type Ia supernova ejects \~{}10 times more iron than
a Type II supernova, [Fe/H] of the nonmerger component tends to be
higher than that of the merger component, which widens the metallicity
distribution function. From these results, we suggest that the Galactic
bulge consists of two chemically different components; one has formed
quickly through the subgalactic clump merger in the proto-Galaxy, and
the other has formed gradually in the inner disk.

metallicity distribution function (MDF) and on the vertical metallicity

spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, LAMOST, RAVE, and Gaia-ESO), which have
different targeting strategies and therefore different selection
functions. We use common fields between the spectroscopic surveys of
APOGEE, LAMOST, RAVE (ALR) and APOGEE, RAVE, Gaia-ESO (AGR) and use two
stellar population synthesis models, GALAXIA and TRILEGAL, to create
mock fields for each survey. We apply the selection function in the form
of colour and magnitude cuts of the respective survey to the mock fields
to replicate the observed source sample. We make a basic comparison
between the models to check which best reproduces the observed sample
distribution. We carry out a quantitative comparison between the
synthetic MDF from the mock catalogues using both models to understand
the effect of the selection function on the MDF and on the vertical
metallicity gradient. Using both models, we find a negligible effect of
the selection function on the MDF for APOGEE, LAMOST, and RAVE. We find
a negligible selection function effect on the vertical metallicity
gradients as well, though GALAXIA and TRILEGAL have steeper and
shallower slopes, respectively, than the observed gradient. After
applying correction terms on the metallicities of RAVE and LAMOST with
respect to our reference APOGEE sample, our observed vertical
metallicity gradients between the four surveys are consistent within
1-sigma. We also find consistent gradient for the combined sample of all
surveys in ALR and AGR. We estimated a mean vertical metallicity
gradient of -0.241+/-0.028 dex kpc-1. There is a significant scatter in
the estimated gradients in the literature, but our estimates are within

deg$^{2}$ of the inner Milky Way in VIJK$_{s}$ photometry
from the OGLE-III (third phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing
Experiment) and VVV (VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea) surveys, with
supporting evidence from diffuse interstellar bands and F435W, F625W
photometry. We obtain independent measurements towards {\tilde}2000
sightlines of A$_{I}$, E(V - I), E(I - J) and E(J -
K$_{s}$), with median precision and accuracy of 2 per cent. We
find that the variations in the extinction ratios A$_{I}$/E(V -
I), E(I - J)/E(V - I) and E(J - K$_{s}$)/E(V - I) are large
(exceeding 20 per cent), significant and positively correlated, as
expected. However, both the mean values and the trends in these
extinction ratios are drastically shifted from the predictions of
Cardelli and Fitzpatrick, regardless of how R$_{V}$ is varied.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that variations in the shape of the
extinction curve have at least two degrees of freedom, and not one (e.g.
R$_{V}$), which we confirm with a principal component analysis. We
derive a median value of $\lt$A$_{V}$/A$_{Ks}$$\gt$ = 13.44,
which is {\tilde}60 per cent higher than the `standard' value. We show
that the Wesenheit magnitude W$_{I}$ = I - 1.61(I - J) is
relatively impervious to extinction curve variations. Given that these
extinction curves are linchpins of observational cosmology, and that it
is generally assumed that R$_{V}$ variations correctly capture
variations in the extinction curve, we argue that systematic errors in
the distance ladder from studies of Type Ia supernovae and Cepheids may
have been underestimated. Moreover, the reddening maps from the Planck
experiment are shown to systematically overestimate dust extinction by
{\tilde}100 per cent and lack sensitivity to extinction curve variations.

boxy/peanut-shaped bulge. Numerous studies of the bulge based on stellar
photometry have concluded that the bulge stars are exclusively old. The
perceived lack of young stars in the bulge strongly constrains its
likely formation scenarios, providing evidence that the bulge is a
unique population that formed early and separately from the disk.
However, recent studies of individual bulge stars using the microlensing
technique have reported that they span a range of ages, emphasizing that
the bulge may not be a monolithic structure. In this Letter we
demonstrate that the presence of young stars that are located
predominantly nearer to the plane is expected for a bulge that has
formed from the disk via dynamical instabilities. Using an N-body+
smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation of a disk galaxy forming out
of gas cooling inside a dark matter halo and forming stars, we find a
qualitative agreement between our model and the observations of younger
metal-rich stars in the bulge. We are also able to partially resolve the
apparent contradiction in the literature between results that argue for
a purely old bulge population and those that show a population comprised
of a range in ages; the key is where to look.

Galactic bulge: did it form via mergers, as expected from {$\Lambda$} cold
dark matter theory, or from disc instabilities, as suggested by its
boxy/peanut shape, or both? Our stars are mostly red clump giants, which
have a well-defined absolute magnitude from which distances can be
determined. We have obtained spectra for 28 000 stars at a spectral
resolution of R = 11 000. From these spectra, we have determined stellar
parameters and distances to an accuracy of $\lt$1.5 kpc. The stars in the
inner Galaxy span a large range in [Fe/H], -2.8 {\le} [Fe/H] {\le} +0.6.
From the spatial distribution of the red clump stars as a function of
[Fe/H], we propose that the stars with [Fe/H] $\gt$ -0.5 are part of the
boxy/peanut bar/bulge. We associate the lower metallicity stars ([Fe/H]
$\lt$ -0.5) with the thick disc, which may be puffed up in the inner
region, and with the inner regions of the metal-weak thick disc and
inner halo. For the bulge stars with [Fe/H] $\gt$ -0.5, we find two
discrete populations: (i) stars with [Fe/H] {\ap} -0.25 which provide a
roughly constant fraction of the stars in the latitude interval b =
-5{\deg} to -10{\deg}, and (ii) a kinematically colder, more metal-rich
population with mean [Fe/H] {\ap} +0.15 which is more prominent closer to
the plane. The changing ratio of these components with latitude appears
as a vertical abundance gradient of the bulge. We attribute both of
these bulge components to instability-driven bar/bulge formation from
the thin disc. We associate the thicker component with the stars of the
early less metal-rich thin disc, and associate the more metal-rich
population concentrated to the plane with the colder more metal-rich
stars of the early thin disc, similar to the colder and younger more
metal-rich stars seen in the thin disc in the solar neighbourhood today.
We do not exclude a weak underlying classical merger-generated bulge
component, but see no obvious kinematic association of any of our bulge
stars with such a classical bulge component. The clear spatial and
kinematic separation of the two bulge populations (i) and (ii) makes it
unlikely that any significant merger event could have affected the inner
regions of the Galaxy since the time when the bulge-forming
instabilities occurred.

formation of the bulge has been internally driven from disc
instabilities as suggested by its boxy shape, or if mergers have played
a significant role as expected from lambda cold dark matter simulations.
From our velocity measurements across latitudes b = -5{\deg}, - 7.5{\deg}
and -10{\deg} we find the bulge to be a cylindrically rotating system
that transitions smoothly out into the disc. From observations of 3
fields at b = +10, the kinematics of the bulge show North-South symmetry
about the major axis. Within the bulge, we find a kinematically distinct
metal-poor population ([Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.0) that is not rotating
cylindrically. The 5 per cent of our stars with [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.0 are a
slowly rotating spheroidal population, which we believe are stars of the

The kinematics of the two bulge components that we identified in ARGOS
Paper III (mean [Fe/H] {\ap} -0.25 and [Fe/H] {\ap} +0.15, respectively)
demonstrate that they are likely to share a common formation origin and
are distinct from the more metal-poor populations of the thick disc and
halo which are co-located inside the bulge. We do not exclude an
underlying merger generated bulge component but our results favour bulge
formation from instabilities in the early thin disc.

  Abstract                 = {{New spectroscopic surveys offer the promise of stellar parameters and
abundances ({\ldquo}stellar labels{\rdquo}) for hundreds of thousands of
stars; this poses a formidable spectral modeling challenge. In many
cases, there is a subset of reference objects for which the stellar
labels are known with high(er) fidelity. We take advantage of this with
The Cannon, a new data-driven approach for determining stellar labels
from spectroscopic data. The Cannon learns from the {\ldquo}known{\rdquo}
labels of reference stars how the continuum-normalized spectra depend on
these labels by fitting a flexible model at each wavelength; then, The
Cannon uses this model to derive labels for the remaining survey stars.
We illustrate The Cannon by training the model on only 542 stars in 19
clusters as reference objects, with $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, $\{$log$\}$ g, and
[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$] as the labels, and then applying it to the spectra of
55,000 stars from APOGEE DR10. The Cannon is very accurate. Its stellar
labels compare well to the stars for which APOGEE pipeline (ASPCAP)
labels are provided in DR10, with rms differences that are basically
identical to the stated ASPCAP uncertainties. Beyond the reference
labels, The Cannon makes no use of stellar models nor any line-list, but
needs a set of reference objects that span label-space. The Cannon
performs well at lower signal-to-noise, as it delivers comparably good
labels even at one-ninth the APOGEE observing time. We discuss the
limitations of The Cannon and its future potential, particularly, to
bring different spectroscopic surveys onto a consistent scale of stellar
labels.

  Abstract                 = {{The mass of a star is arguably its most fundamental parameter. For red
giant stars, tracers luminous enough to be observed across the Galaxy,
mass implies a stellar evolution age. It has proven to be extremely
difficult to infer ages and masses directly from red giant spectra using
existing methods. From the Kepler and apogee surveys, samples of several
thousand stars exist with high-quality spectra and asteroseismic masses.
Here we show that from these data we can build a data-driven spectral
model using The Cannon, which can determine stellar masses to {\sim}0.07
dex from apogee dr12 spectra of red giants; these imply age estimates
accurate to {\sim}0.2 dex (40\%). We show that The Cannon constrains these
ages foremost from spectral regions with CN absorption lines, elements
whose surface abundances reflect mass-dependent dredge-up. We deliver an
unprecedented catalog of 70,000 giants (including 20,000 red clump
stars) with mass and age estimates, spanning the entire disk (from the
Galactic center to R{\sim} 20 kpc). We show that the age information in
the spectra is not simply a corollary of the birth-material abundances
$\{$$\{$[Fe/H]$\}$$\}$ and [{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$], and that, even within a monoabundance
population of stars, there are age variations that vary sensibly with
Galactic position. Such stellar age constraints across the Milky Way
open up new avenues in Galactic archeology.

resemble each other in the high-dimensional space of their photospheric
element abundances and contrast this with pairs of field stars. Our
analysis is based on abundances for 20 elements, homogeneously derived
from APOGEE spectra (with carefully quantified uncertainties of
typically 0.03 dex). We consider 90 red giant stars in seven open
clusters and find that most stars within a cluster have abundances in
most elements that are indistinguishable (in a $\{${$\chi$}
$\}$$^{2}$-sense) from those of the other members, as expected for
stellar birth siblings. An analogous analysis among pairs of $\gt$ 1000
field stars shows that highly significant abundance differences in the
20 dimensional space can be established for the vast majority of these
pairs, and that the APOGEE-based abundance measurements have high
discriminating power. However, pairs of field stars whose abundances are
indistinguishable even at 0.03 dex precision exist: {\sim}0.3\% of all
field star pairs and {\sim}1.0\% of field star pairs at the same (solar)
metallicity [Fe/H] = 0 {\plusmn} 0.02. Most of these pairs are presumably
not birth siblings from the same cluster, but rather doppelg{\"a}ngers.
Our analysis implies that {\ldquo}chemical tagging{\rdquo} in the strict
sense, identifying birth siblings for typical disk stars through their
abundance similarity alone, will not work with such data. However, our
approach shows that abundances have extremely valuable information for
probabilistic chemo-orbital modeling, and combined with velocities, we
have identified new cluster members from the field.

disk at positive longitudes from the SDSS-III APOGEE spectroscopic
survey of the Milky Way. APOGEE includes extensive coverage of the
stellar populations of the bulge along the midplane and near-plane
regions. From these data, we have produced kinematic maps of 10,000
stars across longitudes of 0{\deg} $\lt$ l $\lt$ 65{\deg}, and primarily
across latitudes of | b| $\lt$ 5{\deg} in the bulge region. The APOGEE
data reveal that the bulge is cylindrically rotating across all
latitudes and is kinematically hottest at the very center of the bulge,
with the smallest gradients in both kinematic and chemical space inside
the innermost region (| l,b| ) $\lt$ (5{\deg}, 5{\deg}). The results from
APOGEE show good agreement with data from other surveys at higher
latitudes and a remarkable similarity to the rotation and dispersion
maps of barred galaxies viewed edge-on. The thin bar that is reported to
be present in the inner disk within a narrow latitude range of | b| 
$\lt$ 2{\deg} appears to have a corresponding signature in [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$]
and [{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$]. Stars with [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$] $\gt$ -0.5 have
dispersion and rotation profiles that are similar to that of N-body
models of boxy/peanut bulges. There is a smooth kinematic transition
from the thin bar and boxy bulge (l,| b| ) $\lt$ (15{\deg}, 12{\deg}) out
to the disk for stars with [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$] $\gt$ -1.0, and the
chemodynamics across (l, b) suggests that the stars in the inner Galaxy
with [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$] $\gt$ -1.0 originate in the disk.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Open clusters are known as excellent tools for various topics
in Galactic research. For example, they allow accurately tracing the
chemical structure of the Galactic disc. However, the metallicity is
known only for a rather low percentage of the open cluster population,
and these values are based on a variety of methods and data. Therefore,
a large and homogeneous sample is highly desirable. <BR /> Aims: In the
third part of our series we compile a large sample of homogenised open
cluster metallicities using a wide variety of different sources. These
data and a sample of Cepheids are used to investigate the radial
metallicity gradient, age effects, and to test current models. <BR />
Methods: We used photometric and spectroscopic data to derive cluster
metallicities. The different sources were checked and tested for
possible offsets and correlations. <BR /> Results: In total,
metallicities for 172 open cluster were derived. We used the
spectroscopic data of 100 objects for a study of the radial metallicity
distribution and the age-metallicity relation. We found a possible
increase of metallicity with age, which, if confirmed, would provide
observational evidence for radial migration. Although a statistical
significance is given, more studies are certainly needed to exclude
selection effects, for example. The comparison of open clusters and
Cepheids with recent Galactic models agrees well in general. However,
the models do not reproduce the flat gradient of the open clusters in
the outer disc. Thus, the effect of radial migration is either
underestimated in the models, or an additional mechanism is at work. <BR
/> Conclusions: Apart from the Cepheids, open clusters are the best
tracers for metallicity over large Galactocentric distances in the Milky
Way. For a sound statistical analysis, a sufficiently large and
homogeneous sample of cluster metallicities is needed. Our compilation
is currently by far the largest and provides the basis for several basic
studies such as the statistical treatment of the Galactic cluster
population, or evolutionary studies of individual star groups in open
clusters.

  Abstract                 = {{We employ the first two years of data from the near-infrared,
high-resolution SDSS-III/APOGEE spectroscopic survey to investigate the
distribution of metallicity and {$\alpha$}-element abundances of stars over
a large part of the Milky Way disk. Using a sample of {\ap}10, 000
kinematically unbiased red-clump stars with \~{}5\% distance accuracy as
tracers, the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H] distribution of this sample
exhibits a bimodality in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] at intermediate metallicities,
-0.9 {\lt} [Fe/H] {\lt}-0.2, but at higher metallicities ([Fe/H] \~{}+0.2)
the two sequences smoothly merge. We investigate the effects of the
APOGEE selection function and volume filling fraction and find that
these have little qualitative impact on the {$\alpha$}-element abundance
patterns. The described abundance pattern is found throughout the range
5 {\lt} R {\lt} 11 kpc and 0 {\lt} |Z| {\lt} 2 kpc across the Galaxy. The
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] trend of the high-{$\alpha$} sequence is surprisingly constant
throughout the Galaxy, with little variation from region to region
(\~{}10\%). Using simple galactic chemical evolution models, we derive an
average star-formation efficiency (SFE) in the high-{$\alpha$} sequence of
\~{}4.5 {\times} 10$^{-10}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is quite close to
the nearly constant value found in molecular-gas-dominated regions of
nearby spirals. This result suggests that the early evolution of the
Milky Way disk was characterized by stars that shared a similar
star-formation history and were formed in a well-mixed, turbulent, and
molecular-dominated ISM with a gas consumption timescale
(SFE$^{-1}$) of \~{}2 Gyr. Finally, while the two {$\alpha$}-element
sequences in the inner Galaxy can be explained by a single chemical
evolutionary track, this cannot hold in the outer Galaxy, requiring,
instead, a mix of two or more populations with distinct enrichment
histories.

we describe the basic APOGEE data reduction software that reduces
multiple 3D raw data cubes into calibrated, well-sampled, combined 1D
spectra, as implemented for the SDSS-III/APOGEE data releases (DR10,

presents some challenges for reduction, including automated sky

detected in the IRSF/SIRIUS near-infrared (NIR) survey and those in the
Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and Spitzer/IRAC/GLIMPSE II catalogs.
The central region midl mid lsim3fdg0 and midb mid lsim1fdg0 has been
surveyed in the J, H, and K$_{S}$ bands with the IRSF telescope
and the SIRIUS camera whose filters are similar to the Mauna Kea
Observatories (MKO) NIR photometric system. Combined with the GLIMPSE II
point source catalog, we made K$_{S}$ versus K$_{S}$ -
{$\lambda$} color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) where {$\lambda$}=3.6, 4.5, 5.8,
and 8.0 {$\mu$}m. The K$_{S}$ magnitudes of bulge red clump stars and
the K$_{S}$ - {$\lambda$} colors of red giant branches are used as a
tracer of the reddening vector in the CMDs. From these magnitudes and
colors, we have obtained the ratios of total-to-selective extinction
A\_$\{$K\_S$\}$/E\_$\{$K\_S-{$\lambda$}$\}$ for the four IRAC bands. Combined with
A\_$\{${$\lambda$}$\}$/A\_$\{$K\_S$\}$ for the J and H bands derived by Nishiyama et al.,
we obtain A$_{J}$ :A$_{H}$ :A\_$\{$K\_S$\}$:A $_{[3.6]}$:A
$_{[4.5]}$:A $_{[5.8]}$:A $_{[8.0]}$ =
3.02:1.73:1:0.50:0.39:0.36:0.43 for the line of sight toward the GC.
This confirms the flattening of the extinction curve at {$\lambda$} gsim 3
{$\mu$}m from a simple extrapolation of the power-law extinction at shorter
wavelengths, in accordance with recent studies. The extinction law in
the 2MASS J, H, and K$_{S}$ bands has also been calculated, and
good agreement with that in the MKO system is found. Thus, it is
established that the extinction in the wavelength range of J, H, and
K$_{S}$ is well fitted by a power law of steep decrease A
$_{lambda}$ vprop {$\lambda$}$^{-2.0}$ toward the GC. In
nearby molecular clouds and diffuse interstellar medium, the lack of
reliable measurements of the total-to-selective extinction ratios
hampers unambiguous determination of the extinction law; however,
observational results toward these lines of sight cannot be reconciled
with a single extinction law.

include Sc, Mn, Cu, and Ba to obtain new information on the

with S/N {\gsim} 600 are used to derive very precise ({$\sigma$} \~{} 0.01 dex)
differential abundances of Sc, Mn, Cu, and Ba for 21 solar twins and the
Sun. The analysis is based on MARCS model atmospheres with parameters
determined from the excitation and ionization balance of Fe lines.
Stellar ages with internal errors less than 1 Gyr are obtained by
interpolation in the log g - T$_{eff}$ diagram between isochrones
based on the Aarhus Stellar Evolution Code. <BR /> Results: For stars
younger than 6 Gyr, [Sc/Fe], [Mn/Fe], [Cu/Fe], and [Ba/Fe] are tightly
correlated with stellar age, which is also the case for the other
elements previously studied; linear relations between [X/Fe] and age
have {$\chi$}\^{}2$_{red &tilde; 1}$, and for most stars the residuals
do not depend on elemental condensation temperature. For ages between 6
and 9 Gyr, the [X/Fe] - age correlations break down and the stars split
up into two groups having respectively high and low [X/Fe] for the odd-Z
elements Na, Al, Sc, and Cu. <BR /> Conclusions: While stars in the
solar neighborhood younger than \~{} 6 Gyr were formed from interstellar
gas with a smooth chemical evolution, older stars seem to have
originated from regions enriched by supernovae with different neutron
excesses. Correlations between abundance ratios and stellar age suggest
that: (i) Sc is made in Type II supernovae along with the
{$\alpha$}-capture elements; (ii) the Type II to Ia yield ratio is about
the same for Mn and Fe; (iii) Cu is mainly made by the weak s-process in
massive stars; (iv) the Ba/Y yield ratio for asymptotic giant branch
stars increases with decreasing stellar mass; (v) [Y/Mg] and [Y/Al] can
be used as chemical clocks when determining ages of solar metallicity
stars.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. High-precision determinations of abundances of elements in the
atmospheres of the Sun and solar twin stars indicate that the Sun has an
unusually low ratio between refractory and volatile elements. This has
led to the suggestion that the relation between abundance ratios,
[X/Fe], and elemental condensation temperature, T$_{C}$, can be
used as a signature of the existence of terrestrial planets around a
star. <BR /> Aims: HARPS spectra with S/N {\gsim} 600 for 21 solar twin
stars in the solar neighborhood and the Sun (observed via reflected
light from asteroids) are used to determine very precise ({$\sigma$} \~{} 0.01
dex) differential abundances of elements in order to see how well [X/Fe]
is correlated with T$_{C}$ and other parameters such as stellar
age. <BR /> Methods: Abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr,
Fe, Ni, Zn, and Y are derived from equivalent widths of weak and
medium-strong spectral lines using MARCS model atmospheres with
parameters determined from the excitation and ionization balance of Fe
lines. Non-LTE effects are considered and taken into account for some of
the elements. In addition, precise ({$\sigma$} {\lsim} 0.8 Gyr) stellar ages
are obtained by interpolating between Yonsei-Yale isochrones in the log
g - T$_{eff}$ diagram. <BR /> Results: It is confirmed that the
ratio between refractory and volatile elements is lower in the Sun than
in most of the solar twins (only one star has the same
[X/Fe]-T$_{C}$ distribution as the Sun), but for many stars, the
relation between [X/Fe] and T$_{C}$ is not well defined. For
several elements there is an astonishingly tight correlation between
[X/Fe] and stellar age with amplitudes up to \~{}0.20 dex over an age
interval of eight Gyr in contrast to the lack of correlation between
[Fe/H] and age. While [Mg/Fe] increases with age, the s-process element
yttrium shows the opposite behavior meaning that [Y/Mg] can be used as a
sensitive chronometer for Galactic evolution. The Na/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios
are not well correlated with stellar age, but define a tight Ni-Na
relation similar to that previously found for more metal-poor stars
albeit with a smaller amplitude. Furthermore, the C/O ratio evolves very
little with time, although [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] change by \~{}0.15 dex. <BR />
Conclusions: The dependence of [X/Fe] on stellar age and the [Ni/Fe]-
[Na/Fe] variations complicate the use of the [X/Fe]-T$_{C}$
relation as a possible signature for the existence of terrestrial
planets around stars. The age trends for the various abundance ratios
provide new constraints on supernovae yields and Galactic chemical
evolution, and the slow evolution of C/O for solar metallicity stars is
of interest for discussions of the composition of exoplanets.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Carbon and oxygen abundances in stars are important in many
fields of astrophysics including nucleosynthesis, stellar structure,
evolution of galaxies, and formation of planetary systems. Still, our
knowledge of the abundances of these elements in different stellar
populations is uncertain because of difficulties in observing and
analyzing atomic and molecular lines of C and O. <BR /> Aims: Abundances
of C, O, and Fe are determined for F and G main-sequence stars in the
solar neighborhood with metallicities in the range -1.6 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$
+0.4 in order to study trends and possible systematic differences in the
C/Fe, O/Fe, and C/O ratios for thin- and thick-disk stars as well as
high- and low-alpha halo stars. In addition, we investigate if there is
any connection between C and O abundances in stellar atmospheres and the
occurrence of planets. <BR /> Methods: Carbon abundances are determined
from the {$\lambda$}{$\lambda$} 5052,5380 C i lines and oxygen abundances from
the {$\lambda$}7774 O i triplet and the forbidden [O i] line at 6300
{\AA}. MARCS model atmospheres are applied and non-LTE corrections for
the O i triplet are included. <BR /> Results: Systematic differences
between high- and low-alpha halo stars and between thin- and thick-disk
stars are seen in the trends of [C/Fe] and [O/Fe]. The two halo
populations and thick-disk stars show the same trend of [C/O] versus
[O/H], whereas the thin-disk stars are shifted to higher [C/O] values.
Furthermore, we find some evidence of higher C/O and C/Fe ratios in
stars hosting planets than in stars for which no planets have been
detected. <BR /> Conclusions: The results suggest that C and O in both
high- and low-alpha halo stars and in thick-disk stars are made mainly
in massive (M$\gt$ 8 M$_{&sun;}$) stars, whereas thin-disk stars
have an additional carbon contribution from low-mass AGB and massive
stars of high metallicity causing a rising trend of the C/O ratio with
increasing metallicity. However, at the highest metallicities
investigated ([Fe/H] {\sime} + 0.4), C/O does not exceed 0.8, which seems
to exclude formation of carbon planets if proto-planetary disks have the
same composition as their parent stars.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. A previous study of solar twin stars has revealed the existence
of correlations between some abundance ratios and stellar age providing
new knowledge about nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution. <BR
/> Aims: High-precision abundances of elements are determined for stars
with asteroseismic ages in order to test the solar twin relations. <BR
/> Methods: HARPS-N spectra with signal-to-noise ratios S/N {\gsim} 250
and MARCS model atmospheres were used to derive abundances of C, O, Na,
Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Y in ten stars from the Kepler
LEGACY sample (including the binary pair 16 Cyg A and B) selected to
have metallicities in the range - 0.15 $\lt$ [ Fe / H ] $\lt$ + 0.15 and
ages between 1 and 7 Gyr. Stellar gravities were obtained from seismic
data and effective temperatures were determined by comparing non-LTE
iron abundances derived from Fe I and Fe II lines. Available non-LTE
corrections were also applied when deriving abundances of the other
elements. <BR /> Results: The abundances of the Kepler stars support the
[X/Fe]-age relations previously found for solar twins. [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe],
and [Zn/Fe] decrease by 0.1 dex over the lifetime of the Galactic thin
disk due to delayed contribution of iron from Type Ia supernovae
relative to prompt production of Mg, Al, and Zn in Type II supernovae.
[Y/Mg] and [Y/Al], on the other hand, increase by 0.3 dex, which can
be explained by an increasing contribution of s-process elements from
low-mass AGB stars as time goes on. The trends of [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] are
more complicated due to variations of the ratio between refractory and
volatile elements among stars of similar age. Two stars with about the
same age as the Sun show very different trends of [X/H] as a function of
elemental condensation temperature T$_{c}$ and for 16 Cyg, the two
components have an abundance difference, which increases with
T$_{c}$. These anomalies may be connected to planet-star
interactions.

some important points affecting the levels of accuracy on global stellar
parameters, such as mass, radius, and age, which were raised during the
final discussion of the workshop. We recall how asteroseismic
parameters, especially when coupled with spectroscopy and photometry,
greatly help to reduce uncertainties. We show how poorly known physical
aspects, such as diffusion, rotation, and outer physical conditions,
must however be kept in mind when assessing these uncertainties. We then
summarise the huge advance in terms of spectroscopic follow-up of
seismic targets that took place in the last couple of years opening the
doors for the first results in Galactic Archaeology making use of
seismic distances, masses, radii, and ages. We conclude by presenting
two tables: (1) an update of the table of uncertainties built at the
Sesto workshop in 2013, and (2) a similar table with what should be
reached for Galactic Archaeology purposes.

6325 and NGC 6355. These clusters are embedded in crowded bulge fields.
Both clusters are concentrated and have blue Horizontal Branches, and
NGC 6325 shows a blue tail. We derive a reddening E(B-V) \~{} 0.95 and a
distance from the Sun d$_{sun}$ \~{} 6.9 kpc for NGC 6325, and E(B-V)
\~{} 0.78 and d$_{sun}$ \~{} 8.8 kpc for NGC 6355. They are both at \~{} 1
kpc from the Galactic center, above the plane. The metallicity has been
estimated based on red giant branch morphology, being consistent with an
intermediate metallicity of [Fe/H] \~{} -1.3 for both clusters, at the
lower end of the metallicity distribution of bulge field stars. They add
to the list of blue Horizontal Branch clusters with intermediate
metallicities within the bulge volume.

star-count like description of non-axisymmetric features of the Galaxy
such as the spiral arms, thus removing the axisymmetric crude
assumptions commonly made in most of the analytical descriptions. Spiral
arms perturb the disk distribution functions in the linear response
framework of density-wave theory where we present an analytical formula
of the so-called ''reduction factor'' in terms of Hypergeometric
functions. Moreover, we consider a non-axisymmetric model of extinction
to build CMDs in the presence of arbitrary non-axisymmetric features, an

handle colour magnitude diagrams with a large number of stars and a
genetic algorithm to investigate the parameter space. This galaxy model

  Abstract                 = {{Aims: The iron abundance gradient in the Galactic stellar disk provides
fundamental constraints on the chemical evolution of this important
Galaxy component, however the spread around the mean slope is, at fixed
Galactocentric distance, more than the estimated uncertainties. <BR
/>Methods: To provide quantitative constraints on these trends, we
adopted iron abundances for 265 classical Cepheids (more than 50\% of the
currently known sample) based either on high-resolution spectra or on
photometric metallicity indices. Homogeneous distances were estimated
using near-infrared period-luminosity relations. The sample covers the
four disk quadrants, and their Galactocentric distances range from \~{}5 to
\~{}17 kpc. We provided a new theoretical calibration of the
metallicity-index-color (MIC) relation based on Walraven and NIR
photometric passbands. <BR />Results: We estimated the photometric
metallicity of 124 Cepheids. Among them 66 Cepheids also have
spectroscopic iron abundances and we found that the mean difference is
-0.03{\plusmn}0.15 dex. We also provide new iron abundances, based on
high-resolution spectra, for four metal-rich Cepheids located in the
inner disk. The remaining iron abundances are based on high-resolution
spectra collected by our group (73) or available in the literature
(130). A linear regression over the entire sample provides an iron
gradient of -0.051 {\plusmn} 0.004 dex kpc$^{-1}$. The above slope
agrees quite well, within the errors, with previous estimates based
either on Cepheids or on open clusters covering similar Galactocentric
distances. However, Cepheids located in the inner disk systematically
appear more metal-rich than the mean metallicity gradient. Once we split
the sample into inner (R$_{G}$ $\lt$8 kpc) and outer disk Cepheids,
the slope (-0.130{\plusmn}0.015 dex kpc$^{-1}$) in the former
region is {\ap}3 times steeper than the slope in the latter one (-0.042
{\plusmn} 0.004 dex kpc$^{-1}$). In the outer disk the radial
distribution of metal-poor (MP, [Fe/H] $\lt$-0.02 dex) and metal-rich
(MR) Cepheids across the four disk quadrants does not show a clear trend
when moving from the innermost to the external disk regions. The
relative fractions of MP and MR Cepheids in the 1st and in the 3rd
quadrants differ at the 8{$\sigma$} (MP) and 15{$\sigma$} (MR) levels.
Finally, we found that iron abundances in two local overdensities of the
2nd and of the 4th quadrant cover individually a range in iron abundance
of {\ap}0.5 dex. <BR />Conclusions: Current findings indicate that the
recent chemical enrichment across the Galactic disk shows a clumpy
distribution.

  Abstract                 = {{We present corrections to the Schlegel et al. (SFD98) reddening maps
over the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) northern Galactic cap area. To
find these corrections, we employ what we call the ''standard crayon''
method, in which we use passively evolving galaxies as color standards
to measure deviations from the reddening map. We select these passively
evolving galaxies spectroscopically, using limits on the H{$\alpha$} and [O
II] equivalent widths to remove all star-forming galaxies from the SDSS
main galaxy catalog. We find that by correcting for known reddening,
redshift, color-magnitude relation, and variation of color with
environmental density, we can reduce the scatter in color to below 3\% in
the bulk of the 151,637 galaxies that we select. Using these galaxies,
we construct maps of the deviation from the SFD98 reddening map at 4fdg5
resolution, with 1{$\sigma$} error of \~{}1.5 mmag E(B - V). We find that the
SFD98 maps are largely accurate with most of the map having deviations
below 3 mmag E(B - V), though some regions do deviate from SFD98 by as
much as 50\%. The maximum deviation found is 45 mmag in E(B - V), and
spatial structure of the deviation is strongly correlated with the
observed dust temperature, such that SFD98 underpredict reddening in
regions of low dust temperature. Our maps of these deviations, as well
as their errors, are made available to the scientific community on the
Web as a supplemental correction to SFD98.

abundances are (1) He and N rich, (2) intermediate population, (3) high

well defined He, N, and O gradients across the galactic disk, and the
oxygen gradient is similar to the metallicity gradient derived from GK

have an uncertain origin, but most likely are remnants of former
interactions between the Galaxy and its former satellites.
Triangulum-Andromeda (TriAnd) is one of these halo substructures, found
as an overdensity of 2MASS M giants. We analyzed the region of
Triangulum-Andromeda using photometric data from the Ninth Data Release
of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR9). By comparing the observations
with simulations from the TRILEGAL Galactic model, we were able to
identify and map several scattered overdensities of main sequence stars
that seem to be associated with TriAnd over a large area covering $\sim
500$ deg$^2$. One of these excesses may represent a new stellar
overdensity. We also briefly discuss an alternative hypothesis,
according to which TriAnd is one of the troughs of oscillation rings in
the Galactic disk.

with the major axis located in the Galactic plane and inclined at an
angle i=20+/-3 deg to the Sun-GC line of sight. The obtained
scale-length ratio of the major axis to the minor axis in the Galactic
plane, and to the axis vertical to the plane is 1:0.49(2):0.39(2). We do
not see the evidence for the bulge RR Lyrae stars forming an X-shaped
structure. Based on the light curve parameters, we derive metallicities
of the RRab variables and show that there is a very mild but
statistically significant radial metallicity gradient. About 60\% of the
bulge RRab stars form two very close sequences on the period-amplitude
(or Bailey) diagram, which we interpret as two major old bulge
populations: A and B. Their metallicities likely differ. Population A is
about four times less abundant than the slightly more metal-poor
population B. Most of the remaining stars seem to represent other, even
more metal-poor populations of the bulge. The presence of multiple old
populations indicates that the Milky Way bulge was initially formed
through mergers.

toward the Galactic bulge during the third phase of the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-III), which took place in
2001-2009. Using these standard candles, we show that the ratio of
total-to-selective extinction toward the bulge is given by R$_{I}$
= A$_{I}$ /E(V - I) = 1.080 {\plusmn} 0.007 and is independent of
color. We demonstrate that the bulge RR Lyr stars form a metal-uniform
population, slightly elongated in its inner part. The photometrically
derived metallicity distribution is sharply peaked at [Fe/H] = -1.02
{\plusmn} 0.18, with a dispersion of 0.25 dex. In the inner regions (|l|
$\lt$ 3{\deg}, |b| $\lt$ 4{\deg}) the RR Lyr tend to follow the barred
distribution of the bulge red clump giants. The distance to the Milky
Way center inferred from the bulge RR Lyr is R $_{0}$ = 8.54
{\plusmn} 0.42 kpc. We report a break in the mean density distribution at
a distance of \~{}0.5 kpc from the center indicating its likely flattening.
Using the OGLE-III data, we assess that (4-7) {\times} 10$^{4}$
type ab RR Lyr variables should be detected toward the bulge area of the
ongoing near-IR VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey, where
the uncertainty partially results from the unknown RR Lyr spatial
density distribution within 0.2 kpc from the Galactic center.

  Abstract                 = {Numerical simulations of galaxy formation and observational Galactic Astronomy are two
fields of research that study the same objects from different perspectives. Simulations try to
understand galaxies like our Milky Way from an evolutionary point of view while observers
try to disentangle the current structure and the building blocks of our Galaxy. Due to great
advances in computational power as well as in massive stellar surveys we are now able to
compare resolved stellar populations in simulations and in observations. In this thesis we
use a number of approaches to relate the results of the two fields to each other. The major
observational data set we refer to for this work comes from the Radial Velocity Experiment
(RAVE), a massive spectroscopic stellar survey that observed almost half a million stars in
the Galaxy.
In a first study we use three different models of the Galaxy to generate synthetic stellar
surveys that can be directly compared to the RAVE data. To do this we evaluate the RAVE
selection function to great detail. Among the Galaxy models is the widely used Besan ̧con
model that performs well when individual parameter distribution are considered, but fails
when we study chemodynamic correlations. The other two models are based on distributions
of mass particles instead of analytical distribution functions. This is the first time that such
models are converted to the space of observables and are compared to a stellar survey. We
show that these models can be competitive and in some aspects superior to analytic models,
because of their self-consistent dynamic history. In the case of a full cosmological simulation of
disk galaxy formation we can recover features in the synthetic survey that relate to the known
issues of the model and hence proof that our technique is sensitive to the global structure of
the model. We argue that the next generation of cosmological galaxy formation simulations
will deliver valuable models for our Galaxy. Testing these models with our approach will
provide a direct connection between stellar Galactic astronomy and physical cosmology.
In the second part of the thesis we use a sample of high-velocity halo stars from the RAVE
data to estimate the Galactic escape speed and the virial mass of the Milky Way. In the
course of this study cosmological simulations of galaxy formation also play a crucial role.
Here we use them to calibrate and extensively test our analysis technique. We find the local
Galactic escape speed to be 533+54 km s−1 (90% confidence). With this result in combination
−41with a simple mass model of the Galaxy we then construct an estimate of the virial mass
of the Galaxy. For the mass profile of the dark matter halo we use two extreme models, a
pure Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) profile and an adiabatically contracted NFW profile.
When we use statistics on the concentration parameter of these profile taken from large
dissipationless cosmological simulations we obtain an estimate of the virial mass that is
almost independent of the choice of the halo profile. For the mass M340 enclosed within
R340 = 180 kpc we find 1.3+0.4 −0.3 × 1012 Msol . This value is in very good agreement with a number
of other mass estimates in the literature that are based on independent data sets and analysis
techniques.
In the last part of this thesis we investigate a new possible channel to generate a population
of Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) that is observed in the stellar halo. Commonly, it is assumed
that the velocities of these stars originate from an interaction with the super-massive black
hole in the Galactic center. It was suggested recently that stars stripped-off a disrupted
satellite galaxy could reach similar velocities and leave the Galaxy. Here we study in detail
the kinematics of tidal debris stars to investigate the probability that the observed sample
of HVSs could partly originate from such a galaxy collision. We use a suite of N-body
simulations following the encounter of a satellite galaxy with its Milky Way-type host galaxy.
We quantify the typical pattern in angular and phase space formed by the debris stars and
develop a simple model that predicts the kinematics of stripped-off stars. We show that the
distribution of orbital energies in the tidal debris has a typical form that can be described
quite accurately by a simple function. The main parameters determining the maximum
energy kick a tidal debris star can get is the initial mass of the satellite and only to a lower
extent its orbit. Main contributors to an unbound stellar population created in this way are
massive satellites (Msat > 109 M ). The probability that the observed HVS population is
significantly contaminated by tidal debris stars appears small in the light of our results.},

  Abstract                 = {{We made new estimates of the Galactic escape speed at various
Galactocentric radii using the latest data release of the RAdial
Velocity Experiment (RAVE DR4). Compared to previous studies we have a
database that is larger by a factor of 10, as well as reliable distance
estimates for almost all stars. Our analysis is based on statistical
analysis of a rigorously selected sample of 90 high-velocity halo stars
from RAVE and a previously published data set. We calibrated and
extensively tested our method using a suite of cosmological simulations
of the formation of Milky Way-sized galaxies. Our best estimate of the
local Galactic escape speed, which we define as the minimum speed
required to reach three virial radii R$_{340}$, is
533$^{+54}$$_{-41}$ km s$^{-1}$ (90\% confidence), with
an additional 4\% systematic uncertainty, where R$_{340}$ is the
Galactocentric radius encompassing a mean overdensity of 340 times the
critical density for closure in the Universe. From the escape speed we
further derived estimates of the mass of the Galaxy using a simple mass
model with two options for the mass profile of the dark matter halo: an
unaltered and an adiabatically contracted Navarro, Frenk {\amp} White
(NFW) sphere. If we fix the local circular velocity, the latter profile
yields a significantly higher mass than the uncontracted halo, but if we
instead use the statistics for halo concentration parameters in large
cosmological simulations as a constraint, we find very similar masses
for both models. Our best estimate for M$_{340}$, the mass
interiorto R$_{340}$ (dark matter and baryons), is
1.3$^{+0.4}$$_{-0.3}$ {\times} 10$^{12}$
M$_{&sun;}$ (corresponds to M$_{200}$ =
1.6$^{+0.5}$$_{-0.4}$ {\times} 10$^{12}$
M$_{&sun;}$). This estimate is in good agreement with recently
published, independent mass estimates based on the kinematics of more
distant halo stars and the satellite galaxy Leo I.

Hipparcos and other catalogues. The sample of optical clusters from
ASCC-2.5 is complete up to about 850 pc from the Sun. The symmetry plane
of the clusters' distribution is determined to be at Z\_0=-22{\plusmn}4
pc, and the scale height of open clusters is only 56{\plusmn}3 pc. The
total surface density and volume density in the symmetry plane are
{$\Sigma$}= 114 kpc$^{-2}$ and D(Z\_0)=1015 kpc$^{-3}$,
respectively. We find the total number of open clusters in the Galactic
disk to be of order of 10$^{5}$ at present. Fluctuations in the
spatial and velocity distributions are attributed to the existence of
four open cluster complexes (OCCs) of different ages containing up to a
few tens of clusters. Members in an OCC show the same kinematic
behaviour, and a narrow age spread. We find, that the youngest cluster
complex, OCC 1 (log t{\lt}7.9), with 19 deg inclination to the Galactic
plane, is apparently a signature of Gould's Belt. The most abundant OCC
2 complex has moderate age (log t{\ap}8.45). The clusters of the
Perseus-Auriga group, having the same age as OCC 2, but different
kinematics are seen in breaks between Perseus-Auriga clouds. The oldest
(log t{\ap}8.85) and sparsest group was identified due to a large motion
in the Galactic anticentre direction. Formation rate and lifetime of
open clusters are found to be 0.23{\plusmn}0.03 kpc$^{-2}$
Myr$^{-1}$ and 322{\plusmn}31 Myr, respectively. This implies a
total number of cluster generations in the history of the Galaxy between
30 to 40. We estimate that less than about 10\% of the total Galactic
stellar disk population has ever passed an open cluster membership.

  Abstract                 = {{Context: In a previous paper we obtained King's parameters for 236 of
650 Galactic open clusters identified in the ASCC-2.5. <BR />Aims:
Estimating tidal radii by use of observable parameters available for all
clusters. Bias-free results are required. <BR />Methods: We use methods
of stellar statistics and develop a semi-empirical model of open
clusters. <BR />Results: We check two effects impacting the
determination of tidal radii from a fitting of King's profiles to the
observed density distribution, i.e., ellipticity of open clusters and a
bias depending on distances. Though a typical cluster has an elliptical
form, the effect is rather weak to produce a prominent bias in the
resulting tidal radii. In contrast, a distance dependent bias is not
negligible and can cause a systematic underestimation of tidal radii
computed with ASCC-2.5 data by a factor of two for the most distant
clusters of our sample. This finding is used to correct the original
results for 236 clusters and to extend the system of tidal radii and
masses to all 650 clusters. We found that the semi-major axis of the
projected distribution of cluster members on the sky is a parameter
suited to estimate tidal radii of open clusters of our sample. No
systematic differences are found between measured and calibrated tidal
radii. From the comparison with mass estimates based on star counts and
on the assumption of the Salpeter IMF, empirical evidence is obtained
for an evolution of cluster mass functions starting in young clusters.
<BR />Conclusions: The set of homogeneous parameters available for all
clusters of our sample is extended by tidal radius and mass. Within 850
pc where our sample is complete, the distributions of tidal radii and
masses peak at r$_{t}$ {\ap} 6 pc and log M\_c/m\_{\sun} {\ap} 2.5,
respectively. In young open clusters, the mass distributions show
differences to the Salpeter IMF, and this discrepancy increases with
cluster age.

between 15\% and 50\%, whereas, for the majority of clusters, the tidal
radius was determined with a relative accuracy better than 20\%. Most of
the clusters have tidal masses between 50 and 1000 m\_{\sun}, and for
about half of the clusters, the masses were obtained with a relative

to match observations very well, except for a mismatch of the delta band
system, when using Langhoff's transition moment. It appears too strong
in the calculations. It would be very valuable to perform accurate

stars, based on their s-process elements abundances, and their
classification, i.e., if they share their chemical profile with strong
or mild barium stars. We also intend to shed light on the possible
origins of the different kinds of barium stars. <BR />Methods: Spectra
have been taken by using the FEROS spectrograph at the 1.52 m telescope
of ESO, La Silla. Abundances have been derived for 18 elements, by
matching the synthetic profile with the observed spectrum. <BR
/>Results: We have found that HD 11397 shows a mild enhancement for most
of the s-process elements as well as for some r-process elements. This
star seems to share its abundance profile with the mild Ba-stars.
Although showing some slight chemical anomalies for Y, Sr, Mo, and Pb,
HD 14282 depicts a chemical pattern similar to the normal stars with
slight s-process enhancements.

starting with N-body models for barred discs in different dark matter
haloes. We determine the total mass in the bulge volume of the RCGs
measurement ( {\plusmn} 2.2 {\times} {\plusmn}1.4 {\times} {\plusmn}1.2 kpc)
with unprecedented accuracy and robustness to be 1.84 {\plusmn} 0.07
{\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{&sun;}$. The stellar mass in this
volume varies between 1.25 and 1.6 {\times} 10$^{10}$
M$_{&sun;}$, depending on the amount of dark matter in the bulge.
We evaluate the mass-to-light and mass-to-clump ratios in the bulge and
compare them to theoretical predictions from population synthesis
models. We find a mass-to-light ratio in the K band in the range
0.8-1.1. The models are consistent with a Kroupa or Chabrier initial
mass function (IMF), but a Salpeter IMF is ruled out for stellar ages of
10 Gyr. To match predictions from the Zoccali IMF derived from the bulge
stellar luminosity function requires {\tilde}40 per cent or {\tilde} 0.7
{\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{&sun;}$ dark matter in the bulge
region. The BRAVA data together with the RCGs 3D density imply a low
pattern speed for the Galactic B/P bulge of {$\Omega$}$_{p}$ = 25-30
km s$^{- 1}$ kpc$^{- 1}$. This would place the Galaxy among
the slow rotators (R {\ge} 1.5). Finally, we show that the Milky Way's
B/P bulge has an off-centred X structure, and that the stellar mass
involved in the peanut shape accounts for at least 20 per cent of the
stellar mass of the bulge, significantly larger than previously thought.

  Abstract                 = {{Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars that
form the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. Several examples exist
in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly
abundant in starburst and interacting galaxies. The few YMCs that are
close enough to resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar
mass function and the ecological interplay between stellar evolution and
stellar dynamics. The distant unresolved clusters may be effectively
used to study the star-cluster mass function, and they provide excellent
constraints on the formation mechanisms of young cluster populations.
YMCs are expected to be the nurseries for many unusual objects,
including a wide range of exotic stars and binaries. So far only a few
such objects have been found in YMCs, although their older cousins, the
globular clusters, are unusually rich in stellar exotica. In this
review, we focus on star clusters younger than {\tilde}100 Myr, more than
a few current crossing times old, and more massive than
{\tilde}10$^{4}$M$_{&sun;}$; the size of the cluster and its
environment are considered less relevant as distinguishing parameters.
We describe the global properties of the currently known young massive
star clusters in the Local Group and beyond, and discuss the state of
the art in observations and dynamical modeling of these systems. In
order to make this review readable by observers, theorists, and
computational astrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary
terminology.

ago as an extension of the much older concept of Circumstellar Habitable
Zone. However, the physical processes underlying the former concept are
hard to identify and even harder to quantify. That difficulty does not
allow us, at present, to draw any significant conclusions about the
extent of the GHZ: it may well be that the entire Milky Way disk is
suitable for complex life.

profiles of spiral galaxies, using detailed models for the chemical and
spectrophotometric evolution of galactic discs. The models are
`calibrated' on the Milky Way disc and are successfully extended to
other discs with the help of simple `scaling' relations, obtained in the
framework of semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. We find that our
models exhibit oxygen abundance gradients that increase in absolute
value with decreasing disc luminosity (when expressed in
dexkpc$^{-1}$) and are independent of disc luminosity (when
expressed in dex scalelength$^{-1}$), both in agreement with
observations. We notice an important strong correlation between
abundance gradient and disc scalelength. These results support the idea
of `homologous evolution' of galactic discs.

  Abstract                 = {{Aims.Galactic globular cluster (GC) stars exhibit abundance patterns
that are not shared by their field counterparts, e.g. the
well-documented O-Na and Mg-Al anticorrelations. Recent spectroscopic
observations of GC turnoff stars have provided compelling evidence that
these abundance anomalies were already present in the gas from which the
observed stars formed. A widely held hypothesis is that the gas was
{\ldquo}polluted{\rdquo} by stars that were more massive (and evolving
faster) than the presently observed low-mass stars. In the framework of
this {\ldquo}self-enrichment{\rdquo} scenario for GCs, we present a new
method of deriving the initial mass function (IMF) of the polluters, by
using the O/Na abundance distribution. Methods: We focus on NGC 2808, a
GC for which the largest sample of O and Na abundance determinations is
presently available. We use the abundance distribution of [O/Na] to
derive the amount of polluted material with respect to the original
composition. We explore two scenarios in detail for the self-enrichment
of the cluster, which differ by the assumptions made on the composition
of the polluter ejecta. In each case we consider two classes of possible
{\ldquo}culprits{\rdquo}: massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (4-9
M$_{&sun;}$) and winds of massive stars (WMS) in the mass range
10-100 M$_{&sun;}$. Results: We obtain upper limits for the slope
of the IMF (assumed to be given by a power-law) of the stars initially
more massive than the present turnoff mass. We also derive lower limits
for the amount of stellar residues in NGC 2808. Conclusions: We find
that the polluter IMF had to be much flatter than the presently observed
IMFs in stellar clusters, which agrees with the results of two other GC
IMF determination methods, which we also discuss. Likewise, we find that
the present mass of the GC should be totally dominated by stellar
remnants if the polluters were AGB stars, which is not the case if the
culprits are WMS. We critically analyse the advantages and shortcomings
of each potential polluter class and find the WMS scenario more
attractive.

  Abstract                 = {{We present the results of a comprehensive assessment of companions to
solar-type stars. A sample of 454 stars, including the Sun, was selected
from the Hipparcos catalog with {$\pi$}$\gt$40 mas,
{$\sigma$}$_{pi}$/{$\pi$} $\lt$ 0.05, 0.5 $\lt$= B - V $\lt$= 1.0
(\~{}F6-K3), and constrained by absolute magnitude and color to exclude
evolved stars. These criteria are equivalent to selecting all dwarf and
subdwarf stars within 25 pc with V-band flux between 0.1 and 10 times
that of the Sun, giving us a physical basis for the term ``solar-type.''
New observational aspects of this work include surveys for (1) very
close companions with long-baseline interferometry at the Center for
High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array, (2) close companions with
speckle interferometry, and (3) wide proper-motion companions identified
by blinking multi-epoch archival images. In addition, we include the
results from extensive radial-velocity monitoring programs and evaluate
companion information from various catalogs covering many different
techniques. The results presented here include four new common
proper-motion companions discovered by blinking archival images.
Additionally, the spectroscopic data searched reveal five new stellar
companions. Our synthesis of results from many methods and sources
results in a thorough evaluation of stellar and brown dwarf companions
to nearby Sun-like stars. The overall observed fractions of single,
double, triple, and higher-order systems are 56\% {\plusmn} 2\%, 33\%
{\plusmn} 2\%, 8\% {\plusmn} 1\%, and 3\% {\plusmn} 1\%, respectively, counting
all confirmed stellar and brown dwarf companions. If all candidate,
i.e., unconfirmed, companions identified are found to be real, the
percentages would change to 54\% {\plusmn} 2\%, 34\% {\plusmn} 2\%, 9\%
{\plusmn} 2\%, and 3\% {\plusmn} 1\%, respectively. Our completeness analysis
indicates that only a few undiscovered companions remain in this
well-studied sample, implying that the majority (54\% {\plusmn} 2\%) of
solar-type stars are single, in contrast to the results of prior
multiplicity studies. Our sample is large enough to enable a check of
the multiplicity dependence on various physical parameters by analyzing
appropriate subsamples. Bluer, more massive stars are seen as more
likely to have companions than redder, less massive ones, consistent
with the trend seen over the entire spectral range. Systems with larger
interaction cross sections, i.e., those with more than two components or
long orbital periods, are preferentially younger, suggesting that
companions may be stripped over time by dynamical interactions. We
confirm the planet-metallicity correlation (i.e., higher metallicity
stars are more likely to host planets), but are unable to check it for
brown dwarfs due to the paucity of such companions, implying that the
brown dwarf desert extends over all separation regimes. We find no
correlation between stellar companions and metallicity for B - V $\lt$
0.625, but among the redder subset, metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] $\lt$-0.3)
are more likely to have companions with a 2.4{$\sigma$} significance. The
orbital-period distribution of companions is unimodal and roughly log
normal with a peak and median of about 300 years. The
period-eccentricity relation shows the expected circularization for
periods below 12 days, caused by tidal forces over the age of the
Galaxy, followed by a roughly flat distribution. The mass-ratio
distribution shows a preference for like-mass pairs, which occur more
frequently in relatively close pairs. The fraction of planet hosts among
single, binary, and multiple systems are statistically
indistinguishable, suggesting that planets are as likely to form around
single stars as they are around components of binary or multiple systems
with sufficiently wide separations. This, along with the preference of
long orbital periods among stellar systems, increases the space around
stars conducive for planet formation, and perhaps life.

  Abstract                 = {{The abundances of iron and oxygen are homogeneously determined in a
sample of 523 nearby (d{\lt}150 pc) FGK disk and halo stars with
metallicities in the range -1.5{\lt}[Fe/H]{\lt}0.5. Iron abundances were
obtained from an LTE analysis of a large set of Fe I and Fe II lines
with reliable atomic data. Oxygen abundances were inferred from a
restricted non-LTE analysis of the 777 nm O I triplet. We adopted the
infrared flux method temperature scale and surface gravities based on
Hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes. Within this framework, the
ionization balance of iron lines is not satisfied: the mean abundances
from the Fe I lines are systematically lower by 0.06 dex than those from
the Fe II lines for dwarf stars of T$_{eff}${\gt}5500 K and
[Fe/H]{\lt}0.0, and giant stars of all temperatures and metallicities
covered by our sample. The discrepancy worsens for cooler and metal-rich
main-sequence stars. We use the stellar kinematics to compute the
probabilities of our sample stars to be members of the thin disk, thick
disk, or halo of the Galaxy. We find that the majority of the
kinematically-selected thick-disk stars show larger [O/Fe] ratios
compared to thin-disk stars while the rest show thin-disk abundances,
which suggests that the latter are thin-disk members with unusual
(hotter) kinematics. A close examination of this pattern for disk stars
with ambiguous probabilities shows that an intermediate population with
properties between those of the thin and thick disks does not exist, at
least in the solar neighborhood. Excluding the stars with unusual
kinematics, we find that thick-disk stars show slowly decreasing [O/Fe]
ratios from about 0.5 to 0.4 in the -0.8{\lt}[Fe/H]{\lt}-0.3 range. Using
a simple model for the chemical evolution of the thick disk we show that
this trend results directly from the metallicity dependence of the Type
II supernova yields. At [Fe/H]{\gt}-0.3, we find no obvious indication of
a sudden decrease (i.e., a ''knee'') in the [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] pattern of
thick-disk stars that would connect the thick and thin disk trends at a
high metallicity. We conclude that Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) did not
contribute significantly to the chemical enrichment of the thick disk.
In the -0.8{\lt}[Fe/H]{\lt}+0.3 range, thin-disk stars show decreasing
[O/Fe] ratios from about 0.4 to 0.0 that require a SN Ia contribution.
The implications of these results for studies of the formation and
evolution of the Galactic disk are discussed.

  Abstract                 = {{The HERMES high-resolution spectrograph project aims at exploiting the
specific potential of small but flexible telescopes in observational
astrophysics. The optimised optical design of the spectrograph is based
on the well-proven concept of white-pupil beam folding for
high-resolution spectroscopy. In this contribution we present the
complete project, including the spectrograph design and procurement
details, the telescope adaptor and calibration unit, the detector
system, as well as the optimised data-reduction pipeline. We present a
detailed performance analysis to show that the spectrograph performs as
specified both in optical quality and in total efficiency. With a
spectral resolution of 85 000 (63 000 for the low-resolution fibre), a
spectral coverage from 377 to 900 nm in a single exposure and a peak
efficiency of 28\%, HERMES proves to be an ideal instrument for building
up time series of high-quality data of variable (stellar) phenomena.

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: The nature of the thick disc and its relation to the thin
disc is presently an important subject of debate. In fact, the
structural and chemo-dynamical transition between disc populations can
be used as a test of the proposed models of Galactic disc formation and
evolution. <BR /> Methods: We used the atmospheric parameters,
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundances, and radial velocities, which were determined
from the Gaia-ESO Survey GIRAFFE spectra of FGK-type stars (first nine
months of observations) to provide a chemo-kinematical characterisation
of the disc stellar populations. We focussed on a subsample of 1016
stars with high-quality parameters, covering the volume | Z | $\lt$ 4.5
kpc and R in the range 2-13 kpc. <BR /> Results: We have identified a
thin to thick disc separation in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] vs. [M/H] plane,
thanks to the presence of a low-density region in the number density
distribution. The thick disc stars seem to lie in progressively thinner
layers above the Galactic plane, as metallicity increases and
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] decreases. In contrast, the thin disc population presents a
constant value of the mean distance to the Galactic plane at all
metallicities. In addition, our data confirm the already known
correlations between V$_{phi}$ and [M/H] for the two discs. For
the thick disc sequence, a study of the possible contamination by thin
disc stars suggests a gradient up to 64 {\plusmn} 9 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$. The distributions of azimuthal velocity, vertical
velocity, and orbital parameters are also analysed for the chemically
separated samples. Concerning the gradients with galactocentric radius,
we find, for the thin disc, a flat behaviour of the azimuthal velocity,
a metallicity gradient equal to -0.058 {\plusmn} 0.008 dex
kpc$^{-1}$ and a very small positive [{$\alpha$}/Fe] gradient. For
the thick disc, flat gradients in [M/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] are derived.
<BR /> Conclusions: Our chemo-kinematical analysis suggests a picture
where the thick disc seems to have experienced a settling process,
during which its rotation increased progressively and, possibly, the
azimuthal velocity dispersion decreased. At [M/H] {\ap} -0.25 dex and
[{$\alpha$}/Fe]{\ap} 0.1 dex, the mean characteristics of the thick disc in
vertical distance to the Galactic plane, rotation, rotational
dispersion, and stellar orbits' eccentricity agree with that of the thin
disc stars of the same metallicity, suggesting a possible connection
between these two populations at a certain epoch of the disc evolution.
Finally, the results presented here, based only on the first months of
the Gaia ESO Survey observations, confirm how crucial large
high-resolution spectroscopic surveys outside the solar neighbourhood
are today for our understanding of the Milky Way history.

  Abstract                 = {{In this work we apply and expand on a recently introduced outlier
detection algorithm that is based on an unsupervised random forest. We
use the algorithm to calculate a similarity measure for stellar spectra
from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment
(APOGEE). We show that the similarity measure traces non-trivial
physical properties and contains information about complex structures in
the data. We use it for visualization and clustering of the dataset, and
discuss its ability to find groups of highly similar objects, including
spectroscopic twins. Using the similarity matrix to search the dataset
for objects allows us to find objects that are impossible to find using
their best fitting model parameters. This includes extreme objects for
which the models fail, and rare objects that are outside the scope of
the model. We use the similarity measure to detect outliers in the
dataset, and find a number of previously unknown Be-type stars,
spectroscopic binaries, carbon rich stars, young stars, and a few that
we cannot interpret. Our work further demonstrates the potential for
scientific discovery when combining machine learning methods with modern
survey data.

the Two Micron All Sky Survey (hereafter 2MASS) along with the Stellar
Population Synthesis Model of the Galaxy, developed in Besan{\c c}on,
to constrain the external disc parameters, such as its scale length, its
cutoff radius, and the slope of the warp. To properly interpret the
observations, the simulated stars are reddened using a 3D extinction
map. The shape of the stellar warp is then compared with previous
results and with similar structures in gas and dust. <BR />Results: We
find new constraints on the stellar disc, which is shown to be
asymmetrical, similar to observations of HI. The positive longitude side
is found to be easily modelled with S-shaped warp but with a
significantly smaller slope than the one seen in the HI warp. At
negative longitudes, the disc presents peculiarities that are not
reproduced well by any simple model. Finally, comparing with the warp
seen in the dust, it seems to follow an intermediate slope between the
gas and the stars.

impact of stellar mass on protoplanetary disk evolution. We divide this
sample into two stellar mass bins (2 M\$\_$\{$$\backslash$odot$\}$\$ boundary) and two age
bins (3 Myr boundary), and use infrared excesses over the photospheric
emission to classify objects in three groups: protoplanetary disks,
evolved disks, and diskless. The homogeneous analysis and bias
corrections allow for a statistically significant inter-comparison of
the obtained results. We find robust statistical evidence of disk
evolution dependence with stellar mass. Our results, combined with
previous studies on disk evolution, confirm that protoplanetary disks
evolve faster and/or earlier around high-mass ({\gt} 2 M\$\_$\{$$\backslash$odot$\}$\$)
stars. We also find a roughly constant level of evolved disks throughout
the whole age and stellar mass spectra. We conclude that protoplanetary
disk evolution depends on stellar mass. Such a dependence could have
important implications for gas giant planet formation and migration, and
could contribute to explaining the apparent paucity of hot Jupiters

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Transitional disks are circumstellar disks with inner holes
that in some cases are produced by planets and/or substellar companions
in these systems. For this reason, these disks are extremely important
for the study of planetary system formation. <BR /> Aims: The Herschel
Space Observatory provides an unique opportunity for studying the outer
regions of protoplanetary disks. In this work we update previous
knowledge on the transitional disks in the Chamaeleon I and II regions
with data from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey. <BR /> Methods: We
propose a new method for transitional disk classification based on the
WISE 12 {$\mu$}m - PACS 70 {$\mu$}m color, together with inspection of the
Herschel images. We applied this method to the population of Class II
sources in the Chamaeleon region and studied the spectral energy
distributions of the transitional disks in the sample. We also built the
median spectral energy distribution of Class II objects in these regions
for comparison with transitional disks. <BR /> Results: The proposed
method allows a clear separation of the known transitional disks from
the Class II sources. We find six transitional disks, all previously
known, and identify five objects previously thought to be transitional
as possibly non-transitional. We find higher fluxes at the PACS
wavelengths in the sample of transitional disks than those of Class II
objects. <BR /> Conclusions: We show the Herschel 70 {$\mu$}m band to be a
robust and efficient tool for transitional disk identification. The
sensitivity and spatial resolution of Herschel reveals a significant
contamination level among the previously identified transitional disk
candidates for the two regions, which calls for a revision of previous
samples of transitional disks in other regions. The systematic excess
found at the PACS bands could be either a result of the mechanism that
produces the transitional phase, or an indication of different
evolutionary paths for transitional disks and Class II sources.

(1 to 100 Myr) nearby (within 500 pc) associations over the entire mass
spectrum using photometry covering from the optical to the mid-infrared.
<BR /> Methods: We compiled a catalog of 2340
spectroscopically-confirmed members of these nearby associations. We
analyzed their spectral energy distributions and searched for excess
related to the presence of protoplanetary disks. The dataset has been
analyzed in a homogeneous and consistent way, allowing for meaningful
inter-comparison of results obtained for individual regions. Special
attention was given to the sensitivity limits and spatial completeness
of the observations. <BR /> Results: We derive disk fractions as probed
by mid-infrared excess in the 22 regions. The unprecedented size of our
sample allows us to confirm the timescale of disk decay reported in the
literature and to find new trends. The fraction of excess sources
increases systematically if measured at longer wavelengths. Disk
percentages derived using different wavelength ranges should therefore
be compared with caution. The dust probed at 22-24 {$\mu$}m evolves slower
than that probed at shorter wavelengths (3.4-12 {$\mu$}m). Assuming an
exponential decay, we derive a timescale {$\tau$} = 4.2 - 5.8 Myr at 22-24
{$\mu$}m for primordial disks, compared to 2 \~{} 3 Myr at shorter wavelengths
(3.4-12 {$\mu$}m). Primordial disks disappear around 10 \~{} 20 Myr. Their
decline matches in time a brief increase of the number of ''evolved''
disks (defined here as including transitional and debris disks). There
is more dispersion in the fraction of excess sources with age when
measured at 22-24 {$\mu$}m in comparison to shorter wavelengths. <BR />
Conclusions: The increase in timescale of excess decay at longer
wavelength is compatible with inside-out disk clearing scenarios. The
increased timescale of decay and larger dispersion in the distribution
of disk fractions at 22-24 {$\mu$}m suggest that the inner
(terrestrial-planet forming) and outer (giant-planet forming) zones
evolve differently, the latter potentially following a variety of
evolutionary paths. The drop of primordial disks and the coincident rise
of evolved disks at 10 Myr are compatible with planet formation theories
suggesting that the disappearance of the gas is immediately followed by
the dynamical stirring of the disk.

construct a longitude-velocity plot for the bulge stars and the model

rotate as a solid body. From -5$^{deg}$$\lt$l$\lt$+5$^{deg}$
the rotation curve has a slope of roughly 100 km s$^{-1}$
kpc$^{-1}$ and flattens considerably at greater l, reaching a
maximum rotation of 45 km s$^{-1}$. We compare our rotation curve
and velocity dispersion profile to both the self-consistent model of
Zhao and to N-body models; neither fits both our observed rotation curve

velocities (\~{}3 km s$^{-1}$) yields an unexpected result: hints of
cold kinematic features are seen in a number of the line-of-sight

Multi-wavelength observations demonstrate that neutral and ionized
gaseous halos of galaxies are common, and that they extend deep into
intergalactic space. These studies suggest that the gaseous material
around spiral galaxies is tightly connected to the on-going hierarchical
formation and evolution of these galaxies. In the last part of this
article I summarize recent quasar absorption-line measurements of the
local intergalactic medium. In accordance with cosmological simulations,
absorption-line studies in the far-ultraviolet indicate that both the

  Abstract                 = {{The Milky Way is surrounded by large amounts of gaseous matter that are
slowly being accreted over cosmic timescales to support star formation
in the disk. The corresponding gas-accretion rate represents a key
parameter for the past, present, and future evolution of the Milky Way.
In this article, I discuss our current understanding of gas accretion
processes in the Galaxy by reviewing past and recent observational and
theoretical studies. The first part of this review deals with the
spatial distribution of the different gas phases in the Milky Way halo,
the origin of the gas, and its total mass. The second part discusses the
gas dynamics and the physical processes that regulate the gas flow from
the outer Galactic halo to the disk. From the most recent studies
follows that the present-day gas accretion rate of the Milky Way is a
few solar masses per year, which is sufficient to maintain the Galaxy's
star-formation rate at its current level.

galaxy population with QSO absorption-line measurements to geometrically
model the three-dimensional distribution of infalling neutral-gas clouds
(''high-velocity clouds'' (HVCs)) in the extended halos of low-redshift
galaxies. We demonstrate that the observed distribution of HVCs around
the Milky Way and M31 can be modeled by a radial exponential decline of
the mean H I volume-filling factor in their halos. Our model suggests a
characteristic radial extent of HVCs of R $_{halo}$ \~{} 50 kpc, a
total H I mass in HVCs of \~{}10$^{8}$ M $_{&sun;}$, and a
neutral-gas accretion rate of \~{}0.7 M $_{&sun;}$ yr$^{-1}$
for M31/Milky-Way-type galaxies. Using a Holmberg-like luminosity
scaling of the halo size of galaxies we estimate R $_{halo}$ \~{} 110
kpc for the most massive galaxies. The total absorption cross-section of
HVCs at z {\ap} 0 most likely is dominated by galaxies with total H I
masses between 10$^{8.5}$ and 10$^{10}$ M $_{&sun;}$.
Our model indicates that the H I disks of galaxies and their surrounding
HVC population can account for 30\%-100\% of intervening QSO
absorption-line systems with log N(H I) {\gt}= 17.5 at z {\ap} 0. We
estimate that the neutral-gas accretion rate density of galaxies at low
redshift from infalling HVCs is dM\_H$\backslash$,$\backslash$mathsc$\{$i$\}$/dt/dV $\backslash$approx
0.022$\backslash$,M\_$\{$$\backslash$odot $\}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, which is close to
the measured star formation rate density in the local universe. HVCs
thus may play an important role in the ongoing formation and evolution
of galaxies.

  Abstract                 = {{To explore the origin of high-velocity gas in the direction of the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) we analyze absorption lines in the ultraviolet
spectrum of a Galactic halo star that is located in front of the LMC at
d=9.2 kpc distance. We study the velocity-component structure of low and
intermediate metal ions in the spectrum of RXJ0439.8-6809, as obtained
with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard HST, and measure
equivalent widths and column densities for these ions. We supplement our
COS data with a Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer spectrum of the
nearby LMC star Sk-69 59 and with HI 21cm data from the
Leiden-Argentina-Bonn (LAB) survey. Metal absorption towards
RXJ0439.8-6809 is unambiguously detected in three different velocity
components near v\_LSR=0,+60, and +150 km/s. The presence of absorption
proves that all three gas components are situated in front of the star,
thus being located in the disk and inner halo of the Milky Way. For the
high-velocity cloud (HVC) at v\_LSR=+150 km/s we derive an oxygen
abundance of [O/H]=-0.63 (\~{}0.2 solar) from the neighbouring Sk-69 59
sightline, in accordance with previous abundance measurements for this
HVC. From the observed kinematics we infer that the HVC hardly
participates in the Galactic rotation. Our study shows that the HVC
towards the LMC represents a Milky Way halo cloud that traces low-column
density gas with relatively low metallicity. It rules out scenarios in
which the HVC represents material close to the LMC that stems from a LMC
outflow.

  Abstract                 = {{We present a systematic study of weak intervening Ca ii absorbers at low
redshift (z {\lt} 0.5), based on the analysis of archival high-resolution
(R {\ge} 45 000) optical spectra of 304 quasars and active galactic
nuclei observed with VLT/UVES. Along a total redshift path of {$\Delta$}z
{\ap} 100 we detected 23 intervening Ca ii absorbers in both the Ca ii H
{\amp} K lines, with rest frame equivalent widths W$_{r,3934}$ =
15-799 m{\AA} and column densities log N(Ca ii) = 11.25-13.04
(obtained by fitting Voigt-profile components). We obtain a
bias-corrected number density of weak intervening Ca ii absorbers of
$\{$d$\{$N$\}$/dz=0.117 {\plusmn} 0.044$\}$ at {\mlab}z$_{abs}${\mrab} = 0.35 for
absorbers with log N(Ca ii) {\ge} 11.65 (W$_{r,3934}$ {\ge} 32
m{\AA}). This is 2.6 times the value obtained for damped Lyman
{$\alpha$} absorbers (DLAs) at low redshift. All Ca ii absorbers in our
sample show associated absorption by other low ions such as Mg ii and Fe
ii; 45 percent of them have associated Na i absorption. From ionization
modelling we conclude that intervening Ca ii absorption with log N(Ca
ii) {\ge} 11.5 arises in DLAs, sub-DLAs and Lyman-limit systems (LLS) at
H i column densities of log N(H i) {\ge} 17.4. Using supplementary H i
information for nine of the absorbers we find that the Ca ii/H i ratio
decreases strongly with increasing H i column density, indicating a
column-density-dependent dust depletion of Ca. The observed column
density distribution function of Ca ii absorption components follows a
relatively steep power law, f(N) {\prop} N$^{ - beta}$, with a
slope of - {$\beta$} = -1.68, which again points towards an enhanced dust
depletion in high column density systems. The relatively large cross
section of these absorbers together with the frequent detection of Ca ii
absorption in high-velocity clouds (HVCs) in the halo of the Milky Way
suggests that a considerable fraction of the intervening Ca ii systems
trace (partly) neutral gas structures in the halos and circumgalactic
environment of galaxies (i.e., they are HVC analogs). Based on the
recently measured detection rate of Ca ii absorption in the Milky Way
HVCs we estimate that the mean (projected) Ca ii covering fraction of
galaxies and their gaseous halos is {\mlab}f$_{c,CaII}${\mrab} =
0.33. Using this value and considering all galaxies with luminosities L
{\ge} 0.05 L$^{ * }$ we calculate that the characteristic
radial extent of (partly) neutral gas clouds with log N(H i) {\ge} 17.4
around low-redshift galaxies is R$_{HVC}$ {\ap} 55 kpc.

  Abstract                 = {{The stellar yields for galactic modeling applications (SYGMA) code is an
open-source module that models the chemical ejecta and feedback of
simple stellar populations (SSPs). It is intended for use in
hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models of galactic chemical
evolution. The module includes the enrichment from asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars, massive stars, SNIa and neutron-star mergers. An
extensive and extendable stellar yields library includes the NuGrid
yields with all elements and many isotopes up to Bi. Stellar feedback
from mechanic and frequency-dependent radiative luminosities are
computed based on NuGrid stellar models and their synthetic spectra. The
module further allows for customizable initial-mass functions and
supernova Ia (SNIa) delay-time distributions to calculate time-dependent
ejecta based on stellar yield input. A variety of r-process sites can be
included. A comparison of SSP ejecta based on NuGrid yields with those
from Portinari et al. (1998) and Marigo (2001) reveals up to a factor of
3.5 and 4.8 less C and N enrichment from AGB stars at low metallicity, a
result we attribute to NuGrid's modeling of hot-bottom burning.
Different core-collapse supernova explosion and fallback prescriptions
may lead to substantial variations for the accumulated ejecta of C, O
and Si in the first $10^7\, \mathrm{yr}$ at $Z=0.001$. An online
interface of the open-source SYGMA module enables interactive
simulations, analysis and data extraction of the evolution of all
species formed by the evolution of simple stellar populations.

evolution code and are evolved up to the AGB, the white dwarf stage, or
until core collapse. The nucleosynthesis was calculated for all isotopes
in post-processing with the NuGrid mppnp code. Explosive nucleosynthesis
is based on semi-analytic 1D shock models. Metallicity-dependent mass
loss, convective boundary mixing in low- and intermediate mass models
and H and He core burning massive star models is included. Convective
O-C shell mergers in some stellar models lead to the strong production
of odd-Z elements P, Cl, K and Sc. In AGB models with hot dredge-up the
convective boundary mixing efficiency is reduced to accommodate for its
energetic feedback. In both low-mass and massive star models at the
lowest metallicity H-ingestion events are observed and lead to i-process
nucleosynthesis and substantial N-15 production. Complete yield data

  Abstract                 = {{Exploring the bulge region of our Galaxy is an interesting but
challenging quest because of its complex structure and the highly
variable extinction. We re-analyse photometric near-infrared data in
order to investigate why it is so hard to reach a consensus on the shape
and density law of the bulge, as witnessed in the literature. The
apparent orientation of the bulge seems to vary with the range of
longitude, latitude, and the population considered. To solve the problem
we have used the Besan{\c c}on galaxy model to provide a scheme for
parameter fitting of the structural characteristics of the bulge region.
The fitting process allows the shape of the bulge's main structure to be
determined. We explore various parameters and shapes for the bulge
population, based on Ferrer's ellipsoids, and fit the shape of the inner
disc in the same process. The results show that the main structure has a
standard triaxial boxy shape with an orientation of about 13{\deg} with
respect to the Sun-Galactic centre direction. But the fit is greatly
improved when we add a second structure,which is a longer and thicker
ellipsoid. We emphasize that our first ellipsoid represents the main
boxy bar of the Galaxy and that the thick bulge population could be
either (i) a classical bulge slightly flattened by the effect of the
bar's potential; or (ii) an inner thick disc counterpart. With Ferrer's
ellipsoid, the model shows a general agreement with 2MASS data at the
level of 10\% in the whole bulge region but does not produce the ''double
clump'' feature. However, we show that the double clump seen at
intermediate latitudes can be reproduced by adding a slight flare to the
bar. To characterize the populations better, we further simulate several
fields that have been surveyed in spectroscopy and for which a
metallicity distribution function (MDF) are available. The model agrees
well with these MDF measured along the minor axis if we assume that the
main bar has a mean solar metallicity and the second thicker population
has a lower metallicity. It then naturally creates a vertical
metallicity gradient by mixing the two populations. In the process of
model fitting, we also determine the thin disc parameters. The thin disc
is found to have a scale length of 2.2 kpc, in good agreement with
previous estimates towards the anticentre, but with a large hole of
scale length 1.3 kpc, giving a maximum density in the plane for this
population at about 2.3 kpc from the Galactic centre. In the very
central part of the bulge on top of our two populations, and by
subtracting the fitted ellipsoids, we find evidence of an extra
population in the nuclear region, at 2{\deg} in longitude and 1{\deg} of
latitude from the Galactic centre. Its location corresponds well to the
central molecular zone, and to the Alard nuclear bar.

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: More than 30 years after its discovery, the thick disc of
the Milky Way is not fully explored. We examine the shape of the thick
disc in order to gain insight into the process of its formation. <BR />
Methods: The shape of the thick disc is studied in detail using
photometric data at high and intermediate latitudes from SDSS and 2MASS
surveys. We adopted the population synthesis approach using an
approximate Bayesian computation - Markov chain Monte Carlo (ABC-MCMC)
method to determine the potential degeneracies in the parameters that
can be caused by the mixing with the halo and the thin disc. We
characterised the thick-disc shape, scale height, scale length, local
density, and flare, and we investigated the extent of the thick-disc
formation period by simulating several formation episodes. <BR />
Results: We find that the vertical variation in density is not
exponential, but much closer to a hyperbolic secant squared. Assuming a
single formation epoch, the thick disc is better fitted with a
sech$^{2}$ scale height of 470 pc and a scale length of 2.3 kpc.
However, if one simulates two successive formation episodes, which
mimicks an extended formation period, the older episode has a higher
scale height and a longer scale length than the younger episode, which
indicates a contraction during the collapse phase. The scale height
decreases from 800 pc to 340 pc, the scale length from 3.2 kpc to 2 kpc.
The likelihood is much higher when the thick disc formation extends over
a longer period. We also show that star formation increases from the old
episode to the young and that there is no flare in the outskirt of the
thick disc during the main episode. We compare our results with
formation scenarios of the thick disc. During the fitting process, the
halo parameters are determined as well. If a power-law density is
assumed, it has an exponent of 3.3 and an axis ratio of 0.7.
Alternatively, a Hernquist shape would have an exponent of 2.76, an axis
ratio of 0.77, and a core radius of 2.1 kpc. The constraint on the halo
shows that a transition between an inner and outer halo, if it exists,
cannot be at a distance shorter than about 30 kpc, which is the limit of
our investigation using turnoff halo stars. Finally, we show that
extrapolating the thick disc towards the bulge region explains well the
stellar populations observed there that there is no longer need to
invoke a classical bulge. <BR /> Conclusions: The facts that the
thick-disc episode lasted for several billion years, that a contraction
is observed during the collapse phase, and that the main thick disc has
a constant scale height with no flare argue against the formation of the
thick disc through radial migration. The most probable scenario for the
thick disc is that it formed while the Galaxy was gravitationally
collapsing from well-mixed gas-rich giant clumps that were sustained by
high turbulence, which prevented a thin disc from forming for a time, as
proposed previously. This scenario explains well the observations in the
thick-disc region and in the bulge region.

  Abstract                 = {{We introduce a new set of simulations of Milky Way (MW)-sized galaxies
using the AMR code ART + hydrodynamics in a {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter
cosmogony. The simulation series is called GARROTXA and it follows the
formation of a halo/galaxy from z = 60 to z = 0. The final virial mass
of the system is {\sim}7.4 {\times} 10$^{11}$ M $_{&sun;}$.
Our results are as follows. (a) Contrary to many previous studies, the
circular velocity curve shows no central peak and overall agrees with
recent MW observations. (b) Other quantities, such as M$\backslash$\_$\backslash$ast (6 {\times}
10$^{10}$ M $_{&sun;}$) and R $_{ d }$ (2.56 kpc),
fall well inside the observational MW range. (c) We measure the
disk-to-total ratio kinematically and find that D/T = 0.42. (d) The
cold-gas fraction and star formation rate at z = 0, on the other hand,
fall short of the values estimated for the MW. As a first scientific
exploitation of the simulation series, we study the spatial distribution
of hot X-ray luminous gas. We have found that most of this X-ray
emitting gas is in a halo-like distribution accounting for an important
fraction but not all of the missing baryons. An important amount of hot
gas is also present in filaments. In all our models there is not a
massive disk-like hot-gas distribution dominating the column density.
Our analysis of hot-gas mock observations reveals that the homogeneity
assumption leads to an overestimation of the total mass by factors of
3{\ndash}5 or to an underestimation by factors of 0.7{\ndash}0.1,
depending on the used observational method. Finally, we confirm a clear
correlation between the total hot-gas mass and the dark matter halo mass
of galactic systems.

show that the disk of our Galaxy has experienced enhanced episodes of
star formation at 0-1 Gyr, 2-5 Gyr and 7-9 Gyr ago, although the reality
of the latter burst is still uncertain. The star sample birthsites are
distributed over a very large range of distances because of orbital
diffusion, and so give an estimate of the global star formation rate.
These results are compared with the metal-enrichment rate, given by the
age-metallicity relation, with the expected epochs of close encounters
between our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds, and with previous
determinations of the star formation history. Simulations are used to
examine the age-dependent smearing of the star formation history due to
age uncertainties, and the broadening of the recovered features, as well
as to measure the probability level that the history derived to be
produced by statistical fluctuations of a constant star formation
history. We show, with a significance level greater than 98\%, that the
Milky Way have not had a constant star formation history.

properties of field giants observed far across the Galaxy. Most of such
determinations are, up to now, based on simple scaling relations
involving the large-frequency separation, {$\Delta$}{$\nu$}, and the frequency
of maximum power, {$\nu$}$_{max}$. In this work, we implement
{$\Delta$}{$\nu$} and the period spacing, {$\Delta$}P, computed along detailed
grids of stellar evolutionary tracks, into stellar isochrones and hence
in a Bayesian method of parameter estimation. Tests with synthetic data
reveal that masses and ages can be determined with typical precision of
5 and 19 per cent, respectively, provided precise seismic parameters are
available. Adding independent on the stellar luminosity, these values
can decrease down to 3 and 10 per cent, respectively. The application of
these methods to NGC 6819 giants produces a mean age in agreement with
those derived from isochrone fitting, and no evidence of systematic
differences between RGB and RC stars. The age dispersion of NGC 6819
stars, however, is larger than expected, with at least part of the
spread ascribable to stars that underwent mass-transfer events.

  Abstract                 = {{Context: The Cepheid period-luminosity (PL) relation is unquestionably
one of the most powerful tools at our disposal for determining the
extragalactic distance scale. While significant progress has been made
in the past few years towards its understanding and characterization
both on the observational and theoretical sides, the debate on the
influence that chemical composition may have on the PL relation is still
unsettled. <BR />Aims: With the aim to assess the influence of the
stellar iron content on the PL relation in the V and K bands, we have
related the V-band and the K-band residuals from the standard PL
relations of Freedman et al. (2001, ApJ, 553, 47) and Persson et al.
(2004, AJ, 128, 2239), respectively, to [Fe/H]. <BR />Methods: We used
direct measurements of the iron abundances of 68 Galactic and Magellanic
Cepheids from FEROS and UVES high-resolution and high signal-to-noise
spectra. <BR />Results: We find a mean iron abundance ([Fe/H]) about
solar ({$\sigma$} = 0.10) for our Galactic sample (32 stars), \~{}-0.33 dex
({$\sigma$} = 0.13) for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) sample (22 stars)
and \~{}-0.75 dex ({$\sigma$} = 0.08) for the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)
sample (14 stars). Our abundance measurements of the Magellanic Cepheids
double the number of stars studied up to now at high resolution. The
metallicity affects the V-band Cepheid PL relation and metal-rich
Cepheids appear to be systematically fainter than metal-poor ones. These
findings depend neither on the adopted distance scale for Galactic
Cepheids nor on the adopted LMC distance modulus. Current data do not
allow us to reach a firm conclusion concerning the metallicity
dependence of the K-band PL relation. The new Galactic distances
indicate a small effect, whereas the old ones support a marginal effect.
<BR />Conclusions: Recent robust estimates of the LMC distance and
current results indicate that the Cepheid PL relation is not Universal.

evolve it in a 3D barred Milky Way like galactic potential. We assign
physical properties of the red clump trace population and a realistic 3D
interstellar extinction model. We add Gaia observational constraints and
an error model according to the pre-commissioning scientific performance
assessments. We present and analyse two mock catalogues, offered to the
community, that are an excellent test bed for testing tools being
developed for the future scientific exploitation of Gaia data. The first
catalogue contains stars up to Gaia G{\tilde}20, while the second is the
subset containing Gaia radial velocity data with a maximum error of
{$\sigma$} \_$\{$V\_r$\}$=10 km s$^{-1}$. Here, we present first attempts to
characterize the density structure of the Galactic bar in the Gaia space
of observables. The Gaia large errors in parallax and the high
interstellar extinction in the inner parts of the Galactic disc prevent
us to model the bar overdensity. This result suggests the need to
combine Gaia and IR data to undertake such studies. We find that IR
photometric distances for this Gaia sample allow us to recover the
Galactic bar orientation angle with an accuracy of {\tilde}5{\deg}.

6D phase space information will be available. In this contribution, we
focus on the study of the radial migration stellar kinematic tracers may

large scale disc structure, and the members of the Young Local

ascertain a single origin to these tracers.

  Abstract                 = {{We derive the electron temperature gradient in the Galactic disk using a
sample of H II regions that spans Galactocentric distances 0--17 kpc.
The electron temperature was calculated using high precision radio
recombination line and continuum observations for more than 100 H II
regions. The large number of nebulae widely distributed over the
Galactic disk together with the uniformity of our data provide a secure
estimate of the present electron temperature gradient in the Milky Way.
Because metals are the main coolants in the photoionized gas, the
electron temperature along the Galactic disk should be directly related
to the distribution of heavy elements in the Milky Way. Our derived
abundance gradient is considerably flatter than the oft cited value of
Shaver et al. (1983) (S83). There are no significant variations in the
value of the gradient as a function of Galactocentric radius or azimuth.
 The scatter we find in the H II region electron temperatures at a given
Galactocentric radius is not due to observational error, but rather to
intrinsic fluctuations in these temperatures which are almost certainly
due to fluctuations in the nebular heavy element abundances.

that the inner bulge globular clusters have clearly lower transverse

  Abstract                 = {{We have obtained high-resolution spectra of 23 very metal-poor stars and
present an abundance analysis for 19 of these for elements between Mg
and Eu. The sample comprises roughly equal numbers of dwarfs and giants.
All stars have [Fe/H] $\lt$ -2.5, and 10 have [Fe/H] $\lt$ -3.0. In
addition, for six stars with [Fe/H] $\lt$ -3.0, we compile equivalent
widths from the literature (including our own studies) and recompute
abundances. Possible errors in the stellar atmospheric models are
discussed in detail. Hyperfine-structure corrections are presented for
Mn and Co. We use robust techniques to delineate the main trends in the
[X/Fe] versus [Fe/H] plots and compare these with the Galactic chemical
evolution computations of Timmes, Woosley, {\amp} Weaver.

The main results are as follows: The lowest abundance we derive for a
previously unobserved star is [Fe/H] = -3.57, for CS 22172-002. There
are now six stars with [Fe/H] $\lt$ -3.50 as determined from
high-resolution analyses. The {$\alpha$}elements Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti possess
almost uniform overabundances (relative to iron) down to at least [Fe/H]
= -4, the current limit of observations. [Mg/Fe] increases slightly at
[Fe/H] $\lt$ -2.5, but the slope is only -0.15 dex dex$^{-1}$ and
may be due to systematic errors. Ti behaves like the other
{$\alpha$}elements, contrary to stellar nucleosynthetic calculations. Stars
with [Fe/H] $\lt$ -2.5 reach a plateau in [M/Fe] -0.8 that extends at
least down to [Fe/H] = -4, but Baumueller {\amp} Gehren have advised of
the need for +0.5 dex non-LTE corrections in the dwarfs, leading to a
revised plateau nearer [Al/Fe] {\sime} -0.3. This level is qualitatively
consistent with an odd-even effect for Mg and Al, and in quantitative
agreement with Timmes et al.'s Galactic chemical evolution model. We
confirm the underabundance of [Cr/Fe] and [Mn/Fe], and the overabundance
of [Co/Fe], in stars with [Fe/H] $\lt$ -2.5 that was highlighted by
MeWilliam et al. In addition, we point to a mild overabundance in
[Ni/Fe], though this may be dominated by a few stars that have higher
than normal [Ni/Fe] but that do not reflect an overall trend. Like CS
22949-037, discussed by McWilliam et al., CS 22876-032 shows real
variations in yields, with Al and Mg produced in their normal ratios to
one another but with underabundances in [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], and possibly
[Sc/Fe]. It is clear from several elements that real star-to-star
abundance differences are common at the lowest metallicities. Sr is
measured in most of our stars, but Y and Ba are generally strong enough
only in the giants. [Sr/Fe] shows a spread greater than 2 dex (i.e., by
a factor in excess of 100) at [Fe/H] $\lt$ -3, greatly exceeding
reasonable errors in the measurement This spread exists for both dwarfs
and giants. [Ba/Fe] decreases as [Fe/H] falls below -2.0, and it
exhibits less scatter than [Sr/Fe]. A small number of stars with [Ba/Fe]
$\gt$ 0 deserve further study. CS 22897-008 has high Sr, Y, and C
abundances for its [Fe/H] but normal Ba. This signature may have arisen
from the weak s-process in M$\gt$ 15 M$_{sun}$ stars or by
r-processing.

By combining an analytic description of gaseous supernova remnants with
supernova yields, we show that enrichment of the interstellar medium is
influenced more by supernova physics (explosive energy) than by
environmental conditions (cloud density). If supernova iron-peak yields
are correlated with explosion energy, we can accommodate the
well-defined abundance trends with a chaotic picture for halo formation
involving independently evolving clouds, as was envisaged by Searle
{\amp} Zinn. We calculate that a typical enrichment in the protohalo will
produce [Fe/H] = -2.7. This coincides with larger abundance variations
in field stars of lower metallicity and the lower abundance limit for
Galactic globular clusters.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. H ii regions in galaxies are the sites of star formation, so
they are special places for understanding the build-up of stellar mass
in the universe. The line ratios of this ionized gas are frequently used
to characterize the ionization conditions. In particular, the oxygen
abundances are assumed to trace the chemical enrichment of galaxies. <BR
/> Aims: We explore the connections between the ionization conditions
and the properties of the overall underlying stellar population
(ionizing or not-ionizing) in H ii regions, in order to uncover the
actual physical connection between them. <BR /> Methods: We use the H ii
regions catalog from the CALIFA survey, which is the largest in
existence with more than 5000 H ii regions, to explore their
distribution across the classical [O iii] {$\lambda$}5007/H{$\beta$} vs. [N
ii] {$\lambda$}6583/H{$\alpha$} diagnostic diagram, and the way it depends on
the oxygen abundance, ionization parameter, electron density, and dust
attenuation. The location of H ii regions within this diagram is
compared with predictions from photoionization models. Finally, we
explore the dependence of the location within the diagnostic diagram on
the properties of the host galaxies, the galactocentric distances, and
the properties of the underlying stellar population. <BR /> Results: The
H ii regions with weaker ionization strengths and more metal-rich are
located in the bottom righthand area of the diagram. In contrast, those
regions with stronger ionization strengths and more metal poor are
located in the upper lefthand end of the diagram. Photoionization models
per se do not predict these correlations between the parameters and the
line ratios. The H ii regions located in earlier-type galaxies, closer
to the center and formed in older and more metal-rich regions of the
galaxies are located in the bottom-right area of the diagram. On the
other hand, those regions located in late-type galaxies in the outer
regions of the disks and formed on younger and more metal-poor regions
lie in the top lefthand area of the diagram. The two explored line
ratios show strong correlations with the age and metallicity of the
underlying stellar population. <BR /> Conclusions: These results
indicate that although H ii regions are short-lived events, they are
affected by the total underlying stellar population. One may say that H
ii regions keep a memory of the stellar evolution and chemical
enrichment that have left an imprint on both the ionizing stellar
population and the ionized gas.

  Abstract                 = {{We present the largest and most homogeneous catalog of H ii regions and
associations compiled so far. The catalog comprises more than 7000
ionized regions, extracted from 306 galaxies observed by the CALIFA
survey. We describe the procedures used to detect, select, and analyze
the spectroscopic properties of these ionized regions. In the current
study we focus on characterizing of the radial gradient of the oxygen
abundance in the ionized gas, based on the study of the
deprojecteddistribution of H ii regions. We found that all galaxies
without clear evidence of an interaction present a common gradient in
the oxygen abundance, with a characteristic slope of
{$\alpha$}$_{O/H}$ = -0.1 dex/r$_{e}$ between 0.3 and 2 disk
effective radii (r$_{e}$), and a scatter compatible with random
fluctuations around this value, when the gradient is normalized to the
disk effective radius. The slope is independent of morphology, the
incidence of bars, absolute magnitude, or mass. Only those galaxies with
evidence of interactions and/or clear merging systems present a
significantly shallower gradient, consistent with previous results. The
majority of the 94 galaxies with H ii regions detected beyond two disk
effective radii present a flattening in the oxygen abundance. The
flattening is statistically significant. We cannot provide a conclusive
answer regarding the origin of this flattening. However, our results
indicate that its origin is most probably related to the secular
evolution of galaxies. Finally, we find a drop/truncation of the oxygen
abundance in the inner regions for 26 of the galaxies. All of them are
non-interacting, mostly unbarred Sb/Sbc galaxies. This feature is
associated with a central star-forming ring, which suggests that both
features are produced by radial gas flows induced by resonance
processes. Our result suggests that galaxy disks grow inside-out, with
metal enrichment driven by the local star formation history and with a
small variation galaxy-by-galaxy. At a certain galactocentric distance,
the oxygen abundance seems to be correlated well with the stellar mass
density and total stellar mass of the galaxies, independently of other
properties of the galaxies. Other processes, such as radial mixing and
inflows/outflows seem to have a limited effect on shaping of the radial
distribution of oxygen abundances, although they are not ruled out.

galaxies observed by the CALIFA survey and included all spaxels whose
line emission was consistent with star formation. This type of analysis
allowed us to improve the statistics with respect to previous studies,
and to properly estimate the oxygen distribution across the entire disc
to a distance of up to 3-4 disc effective radii (r$_{e}$). We
confirm the results obtained from classical H ii region analysis. In
addition to the general negative gradient, an outer flattening can be
observed in the oxygen abundance radial profile. An inner drop is also
found in some cases. There is a common abundance gradient between 0.5
and 2.0 r$_{e}$ of {$\alpha$}$_{O / H}$ = - 0.075 dex
/r$_{e}$ with a scatter of {$\sigma$} = 0.016 dex /r$_{e}$ when
normalising the distances to the disc effective radius. By performing a
set of Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we determined that this slope is
independent of other galaxy properties, such as morphology, absolute
magnitude, and the presence or absence of bars. In particular, barred
galaxies do not seem to display shallower gradients, as predicted by
numerical simulations. Interestingly, we find that most of thegalaxies
in the sample with reliable oxygen abundance values beyond \~{}2 effective
radii (57 galaxies) present a flattening of the abundance gradient in
these outer regions. This flattening is not associated with any
morphological feature, which suggests that it is a common property of
disc galaxies. Finally, we detect a drop or truncation of the abundance
in the inner regions of 27 galaxies in the sample; this is only visible
for the most massive galaxies.

  Abstract                 = {{Secular evolution is one of the key routes through which galaxies evolve
along the Hubble sequence. Not only does the disc undergo morphological
and kinematic changes, but a pre-existing classical bulge may also be
dynamically changed by the secular processes driven primarily by the
bar. We study the influence of a growing bar on the dynamical evolution
of a low-mass classical bulge that might be present in galaxies like the
Milky Way. Using self-consistent high-resolution N-body simulations, we
study how an initially isotropic non-rotating small classical bulge
absorbs angular momentum emitted by the bar. The basic mechanism of this
angular momentum exchange is through resonances and a considerable
fraction of the angular momentum is channelled through Lagrange point
(-1:1) and inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) (2:1) orbits. In the phase of
rapid dynamical growth, retrograde non-resonant orbits also absorb
significant angular momentum. As a result of this angular momentum gain,
the initially non-rotating classical bulge transforms into a fast
rotating, radially anisotropic and triaxial object, embedded in the
similarly fast rotating boxy bulge formed from the disc. Towards the end
of the evolution, the classical bulge develops cylindrical rotation. By
that time, its inner regions host a 'classical bulge-bar' whose distinct
kinematics could serve as direct observational evidence for the secular
evolution in the galaxy. Implications of these results are discussed in
brief.

age indicator {$\delta$}(V), which can be obtained for all remaining
clusters, in terms of age and metallicity. Particular care is taken to
ensure consistency in the whole procedure. The resulting Open Cluster
ages connect well to our previous Globular Cluster results. From the
Open Cluster sample, as well as from the combined sample, questions
regarding the formation process of Galactic components are addressed.
The age of the oldest open clusters (NGC 6791 and Be 17) is of the order
of 10 Gyr. We determine a delay by 2.0{\plusmn}1.5 Gyr between the start
of the halo and thin disk formation, whereas thin and thick disk started
to form approximately at the same time. We do not find any significant
age-metallicity relationship for the open cluster sample. The cumulative
age distribution of the whole open cluster sample shows a moderately
significant ({\tilde} 2{$\sigma$} level) departure from the predictions for
an exponentially declining dissolution rate with timescale of 2.5 Gyr.
The cumulative age distribution does not show any trend with
galactocentric distance, but the clusters with larger height to the
Galactic plane have an excess of objects between 2-4 and 6 Gyr with
respect to their counterpart closer to the plane of the Galaxy.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. A growing number of solar-like oscillations has been detected
in red giant stars thanks to the CoRoT and Kepler space-crafts. In the
same way as for main-sequence stars, mode driving is attributed to
turbulent convection in the uppermost convective layers of those stars.
<BR /> Aims: The seismic data gathered by CoRoT on red giant stars allow
us to test the mode driving theory in physical conditions different from
main-sequence stars. <BR /> Methods: Using a set of 3D hydrodynamical
models representative of the upper layers of sub- and red giant stars,
we computed the acoustic mode energy supply rate ($\{$p\_max$\}$). Assuming
adiabatic pulsations and using global stellar models that assume that
the surface stratification comes from the 3D hydrodynamical models, we
computed the mode amplitude in terms of surface velocity. This was
converted into intensity fluctuations using either a simplified
adiabatic scaling relation or a non-adiabatic one. <BR /> Results: From
L and M (the luminosity and mass), the energy supply rate $\{$p\_max$\}$ is
found to scale as (L/M)$^{2.6}$ for both main-sequence and red
giant stars, extending previous results. The theoretical amplitudes in
velocity under-estimate the Doppler velocity measurements obtained so
far from the ground for red giant stars by about 30\%. In terms of
intensity, the theoretical scaling law based on the adiabatic
intensity-velocity scaling relation results in an under-estimation by a
factor of about 2.5 with respect to the CoRoT seismic measurements. On
the other hand, using the non-adiabatic intensity-velocity relation
significantly reduces the discrepancy with the CoRoT data. The
theoretical amplitudes remain 40\% below, however, the CoRoT
measurements. <BR /> Conclusions: Our results show that scaling
relations of mode amplitudes cannot be simply extended from
main-sequence to red giant stars in terms of intensity on the basis of
adiabatic relations because non-adiabatic effects for red giant stars
are important and cannot be neglected. We discuss possible reasons for
the remaining differences.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Determining distances to individual field stars is a necessary
step towards mapping Galactic structure and determining spatial
variations in the chemo-dynamical properties of stellar populations in
the Milky Way. <BR /> Aims: In order to provide stellar distance
estimates for various spectroscopic surveys, we have developed a code
that estimates distances to stars using measured spectroscopic and
photometric quantities. We employ a Bayesian approach to build the
probability distribution function over stellar evolutionary models given
these data, delivering estimates of model parameters (including
distances) for each star individually. Our method provides several
alternative distance estimates for each star in the output, along with
their associated uncertainties. This facilitates the use of our method
even in the absence of some measurements. <BR /> Methods: The code was
first tested on simulations, successfully recovering input distances to
mock stars with {\lsim}1\% bias. We found the uncertainties scale with the
uncertainties in the adopted spectro-photometric parameters. The
method-intrinsic random distance uncertainties for typical spectroscopic
survey measurements amount to around 10\% for dwarf stars and 20\% for
giants, and are most sensitive to the quality of log g measurements. <BR
/> Results: The code was then validated by comparing our distance
estimates to parallax measurements from the Hipparcos mission for nearby
stars ($\lt$300 pc), to asteroseismic distances of CoRoT red giant stars,
and to known distances of well-studied open and globular clusters. The
photometric data of these reference samples cover both optical and
infrared wavelengths. The spectroscopic parameters are also based on
spectra taken at various wavelengths, with varying spectral coverage and
resolution: the Sloan Digital Sky Survey programs SEGUE and APOGEE, as
well as various ESO instruments. <BR /> Conclusions: External
comparisons confirm that our distances are subject to very small
systematic biases with respect to the fundamental Hipparcos scale (+
0.4\% for dwarfs, and + 1.6\% for giants). The typical random distance
scatter is 18\% for dwarfs, and 26\% for giants. For the CoRoT-APOGEE
sample, which spans Galactocentric distances of 4-14 kpc, the typical
random distance scatter is {\sime}15\% both for the nearby and farther
data. Our distances are systematically larger than the CoRoT distances
by about + 9\%, which can mostly be attributed to the different choice of
priors. The comparison to known distances of star clusters from SEGUE
and APOGEE has led to significant systematic differences for many
cluster stars, but with opposite signs and substantial scatter. Finally,
we tested our distances against those previously determined for a
high-quality sample of giant stars from the RAVE survey, again finding a
small systematic trend of + 5\% and an rms scatter of 30\%. Efforts are
underway to provide our code to the community by running it on a public
server.

  Abstract                 = {{The Local Group galaxies offer some of the most discriminating tests of
models of cosmic structure formation. For example, observations of the
Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda satellite populations appear to be in
disagreement with N-body simulations of the `lambda cold dark matter'
({$\Lambda$}CDM) model: there are far fewer satellite galaxies than
substructures in CDM haloes (the `missing satellites' problem); dwarf
galaxies seem to avoid the most massive substructures (the
`too-big-to-fail' problem); and the brightest satellites appear to orbit
their host galaxies on a thin plane (the `planes of satellites'
problem). Here we present results from APOSTLE (A Project Of Simulating
The Local Environment), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
of 12 volumes selected to match the kinematics of the Local Group (LG)
members. Applying the EAGLE code to the LG environment, we find that our
simulations match the observed abundance of LG galaxies, including the
satellite galaxies of the MW and Andromeda. Due to changes to the
structure of haloes and the evolution in the LG environment, the
simulations reproduce the observed relation between stellar mass and
velocity dispersion of individual dwarf spheroidal galaxies without
necessitating the formation of cores in their dark matter profiles.
Satellite systems form with a range of spatial anisotropies, including
one similar to the MWs, confirming that such a configuration is not
unexpected in {$\Lambda$}CDM. Finally, based on the observed velocity
dispersion, size, and stellar mass, we provide estimates of the maximum
circular velocity for the haloes of nine MW dwarf spheroidals.

simulation of the Local Group as candidates for the Milky Way (MW) and
Andromeda (M 31). We focus on the formation of the stellar discs and its
relation to the formation of the group as a rich system with two massive
galaxies, and investigate the effects of mergers and accretion as
drivers of morphological transformations. We also assess the effects of
varying the assumed feedback model on our results by running two
different simulations, a first one where only supernova feedback is
included and a second where we also model radiation pressure from stars.
<BR /> Methods: We use a state-of-the-art hydrodynamical code which
includes star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment to carry out
our study. We use our two simulations, where we include or neglect the
effects of radiation pressure from stars, to investigate the impact of
this process on the morphologies and star formation rates of the
simulated galaxies. <BR /> Results: We find that the simulated M 31 and
MW have different formation histories, even though both inhabit, at z =
0, the same environment. These differences directly translate into and
explain variations in their star formation rates, in situ fractions, and
final morphologies. The simulated M 31 candidate has an active merger
history, as a result of which its stellar disc is unable to survive
unaffected until the present time. In contrast, the MW candidate has a
smoother history with no major mergers at late times, and forms a disc
that grows steadily; at z = 0 the simulated MW has an extended,
rotationally-supported disc that is dominant over the bulge. Our two
feedback implementations predict similar evolutions of the galaxies and
their discs, although some variations are detected, the most important
of which is the formation time of the discs: in the model with weaker
(stronger) feedback the discs form earlier (later). In summary, by
comparing the formation histories of the two simulated galaxies, we
conclude that the particular merger and accretion history of a galaxy
rather than its environment at the LG-scales is the main driver of the
formation and subsequent growth or destruction of galaxy discs.

to simulate the formation of a galaxy in the {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter
structure formation paradigm. The various runs (13 in total) differ in
their numerical hydrodynamical treatment [smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH), moving mesh and adaptive mesh refinement] but share
the same initial conditions and adopt in each case their latest
published model of gas cooling, star formation and feedback. Despite the
common halo assembly history, we find large code-to-code variations in
the stellar mass, size, morphology and gas content of the galaxy at z=
0, due mainly to the different implementations of star formation and
feedback. Compared with observation, most codes tend to produce an
overly massive galaxy, smaller and less gas rich than typical spirals,
with a massive bulge and a declining rotation curve. A stellar disc is
discernible in most simulations, although its prominence varies widely
from code to code. There is a well-defined trend between the effects of
feedback and the severity of the disagreement with observed spirals. In
general, models that are more effective at limiting the baryonic mass of
the galaxy come closer to matching observed galaxy scaling laws, but
often to the detriment of the disc component. Although numerical
convergence is not particularly good for any of the codes, our
conclusions hold at two different numerical resolutions. Some
differences can also be traced to the different numerical techniques;
for example, more gas seems able to cool and become available for star
formation in grid-based codes than in SPH. However, this effect is small
compared to the variations induced by different feedback prescriptions.
We conclude that state-of-the-art simulations cannot yet uniquely
predict the properties of the baryonic component of a galaxy, even when
the assembly history of its host halo is fully specified. Developing
feedback algorithms that can effectively regulate the mass of a galaxy
without hindering the formation of high angular momentum stellar discs
remains a challenge.

properties. Here we extend this analysis to study how the formation
history, structure and dynamics of discs and spheroids relate to the
assembly history and structure of their haloes. We find that discs are
generally young, with stars spanning a wide range of stellar age: the
youngest stars define thin discs and have near-circular orbits, while
the oldest stars form thicker discs that rotate {\tilde}2 times slower
than the thin components, and have 2-3 times larger velocity
dispersions. Unlike the discs, spheroids form early and on short
time-scales, and are dominated by velocity dispersion. We find great
variety in their structure. The inner regions are bar- or bulge-like,
while the extended outer haloes are rich in complex non-equilibrium
structures such as stellar streams, shells and clumps. Our discs have
very high in situ fractions, i.e. most of their stars formed in the disc
itself. Nevertheless, there is a non-negligible contribution ({\tilde}15
per cent) from satellites that are accreted on nearly coplanar orbits.
The inner regions of spheroids also have relatively high in situ
fractions, but 65-85 per cent of their outer stellar population is
accreted. We analyse the circular velocities, rotation velocities and
velocity dispersions of our discs and spheroids, both for gas and stars,
showing that the dynamical structure is complex as a result of the
non-trivial interplay between cooling and supernova heating.

similar in mass to the Milky Way and extracted from a large cosmological
simulation without restriction on spin parameter or merger history. This
allows us to investigate how the final properties of the simulated
galaxies correlate with the formation histories of their haloes. We find
that, at z = 0, none of our galaxies contains a disc with more than 20
per cent of its total stellar mass. Four of the eight galaxies
nevertheless have well-formed disc components, three have dominant
spheroids and very small discs, and one is a spheroidal galaxy with no
disc at all. The z = 0 spheroids are made of old stars, while discs are
younger and formed from the inside-out. Neither the existence of a disc
at z = 0 nor the final disc-to-total mass ratio seems to depend on the
spin parameter of the halo. Discs are formed in haloes with spin
parameters as low as 0.01 and as high as 0.05; galaxies with little or
no disc component span the same range in spin parameter. Except for one
of the simulated galaxies, all have significant discs at z {\gt}\~{} 2,
regardless of their z = 0 morphologies. Major mergers and instabilities
which arise when accreting cold gas is misaligned with the stellar disc
trigger a transfer of mass from the discs to the spheroids. In some
cases, discs are destroyed, while in others, they survive or reform.
This suggests that the survival probability of discs depends on the
particular formation history of each galaxy. A realistic {$\Lambda$}CDM
model will clearly require weaker star formation at high redshift and
later disc assembly than occurs in our models.

  Abstract                 = {{This note attempts to interpret some of the recent findings about a
downtrend in the mean azimuthal velocity of low [{$\alpha$}/Fe] thin disc
stars with increasing metallicity. The presence of such a trend was
predicted in the model of [19], albeit with a slightly steeper slope. We
show that in a simple picture a Galactic disc without mixing in angular
momenta would display an exceedingly steep trend, while in the case of
complete mixing of all stars the trend has to vanish. The difference
between model and observational data can hence be interpreted as the
consequence of the radial abundance gradient in the model being too high
resulting in an underestimate of the migration strength. We shortly
discuss the value of eccentricity distributions in constraining
structure and history of the Galactic disc.

  Abstract                 = {{We present a unified framework to derive fundamental stellar parameters
by combining all available observational and theoretical information for
a star. The algorithm relies on the method of Bayesian inference, which
for the first time directly integrates the spectroscopic analysis
pipeline based on the global spectrum synthesis and allows for
comprehensive and objective error calculations given the priors.
Arbitrary input data sets can be included into our analysis and other
stellar quantities, in addition to stellar age, effective temperature,
surface gravity, and metallicity, can be computed on demand. We lay out
the mathematical framework of the method and apply it to several
observational data sets, including high- and low-resolution spectra
(UVES, NARVAL, HARPS, SDSS/SEGUE). We find that simpler approximations
for the spectroscopic probability distribution function, which are
inherent to past Bayesian approaches, lead to deviations of several
standard deviations and unreliable errors on the same data. By its
flexibility and the simultaneous analysis of multiple independent
measurements for a star, it will be ideal to analyse and cross-calibrate
the large ongoing and forthcoming surveys, like Gaia-European Southern
Observatory (ESO), SDSS, Gaia and LSST.

  Abstract                 = {{We present a new method for detecting and correcting systematic errors
in the distances to stars when both proper motions and line-of-sight
velocities are available. The method, which is applicable for samples of
200 or more stars that have a significant extension on the sky, exploits
correlations between the measured U, V and W velocity components that
are introduced by distance errors. We deliver a formalism to describe
and interpret the specific imprints of distance errors including
spurious velocity correlations and shifts of mean motion in a sample. We
take into account correlations introduced by measurement errors,
Galactic rotation and changes in the orientation of the velocity
ellipsoid with position in the Galaxy. Tests on pseudo-data show that
the method is more robust and sensitive than traditional approaches to
this problem. We investigate approaches to characterizing the
probability distribution of distance errors, in addition to the mean
distance error, which is the main theme of the paper. Stars with the
most overestimated distances bias our estimate of the overall distance
scale, leading to the corrected distances being slightly too small. We
give a formula that can be used to correct for this effect. We apply the
method to samples of stars from the Sloan Extension for Galactic
Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) survey, exploring optimal gravity
cuts, sample contamination, and correcting the used distance relations.

  Abstract                 = {{We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies
and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical
simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black
holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard {$\Lambda$}
cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such
simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained
subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major
improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active
galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas
without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces,
allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading
factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from
first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar
mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass
relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy
stellar mass function is reproduced to {\lsim} 0.2 dex over the full
resolved mass range, 10$^{8}$ $\lt$ M$_{*}$/M$_{&sun;}$
{\lsim} 10$^{11}$, a level of agreement close to that attained by
semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations.
We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift
observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement
with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive
fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy
clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O
VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are
consistent with observations for M$_{*}$ {\gsim} 10$^{9}$
M$_{&sun;}$ (M$_{*}$ {\gsim} 10$^{10}$
M$_{&sun;}$ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently
steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and
temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy
groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating
temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE
simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher
resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable
new resource for studies of galaxy formation.

  Abstract                 = {{Formation of globular clusters (GCs), the Galactic bulge, or galaxy
bulges in general, are important unsolved problems in Galactic
astronomy. Homogeneous infrared observations of large samples of stars
belonging to GCs and the Galactic bulge field are one of the best ways
to study these problems. We report the discovery by APOGEE of a
population of field stars in the inner Galaxy with abundances of N, C,
and Al that are typically found in GC stars. The newly discovered stars
have high [N/Fe], which is correlated with [Al/Fe] and anti-correlated
with [C/Fe]. They are homogeneously distributed across, and
kinematically indistinguishable from, other field stars in the same
volume. Their metallicity distribution is seemingly unimodal, peaking at
[Fe/H]\~{}-1, thus being in disagreement with that of the Galactic GC
system. Our results can be understood in terms of different scenarios.
N-rich stars could be former members of dissolved GCs, in which case the
mass in destroyed GCs exceeds that of the surviving GC system by a
factor of \~{}8. In that scenario, the total mass contained in so-called
``first-generation'' stars cannot be larger than that in
``second-generation'' stars by more than a factor of \~{}9 and was certainly
smaller. Conversely, our results may imply the absence of a mandatory
genetic link between ``second generation'' stars and GCs. Last, but not
least, N-rich stars could be the oldest stars in the Galaxy, the
by-products of chemical enrichment by the first stellar generations
formed in the heart of the Galaxy.

uncertainties of 56, 34, 25, and 29 mmag in the colors u - g, g - r, r -
i, and i - z, per star, though the uncertainty varies depending on the
stellar type and the magnitude of the star. The spectrum-based reddening
measurements confirm our earlier ''blue tip'' reddening measurements,
finding reddening coefficients different by -3\%, 1\%, 1\%, and 2\% in u -
g, g - r, r - i, and i - z from those found by the blue tip method,
after removing a 4\% normalization difference. These results prefer an
R$_{V}$ = 3.1 Fitzpatrick reddening law to O'Donnell or Cardelli
et al. reddening laws. We provide a table of conversion coefficients
from the Schlegel et al. (SFD) maps of E(B - V) to extinction in 88
bandpasses for four values of R$_{V}$ , using this reddening law

  Abstract                 = {{We present a precise photometric calibration of the first 1.5 years of
science imaging from the Pan-STARRS1 survey (PS1), an ongoing optical
survey of the entire sky north of declination -30{\deg} in five bands.
Building on the techniques employed by Padmanabhan et al. in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we use repeat PS1 observations of stars to
perform the relative calibration of PS1 in each of its five bands,
simultaneously solving for the system throughput, the atmospheric
transparency, and the large-scale detector flat field. Both internal
consistency tests and comparison against the SDSS indicate that we
achieve relative precision of {\lt}10 mmag in g, r, and i $_{P1}$,
and \~{}10 mmag in z and y $_{P1}$. The spatial structure of the
differences with the SDSS indicates that errors in both the PS1 and SDSS
photometric calibration contribute similarly to the differences. The
analysis suggests that both the PS1 system and the Haleakala site will
enable {\lt}1\% photometry over much of the sky.

Pan-STARRS1 stellar photometry. The map covers almost the entire sky
north of declination -30{\deg} at a resolution of 7'-14', and is
based on the estimated distances and reddenings to more than 500 million
stars. The technique is designed to map dust in the Galactic plane,
where many other techniques are stymied by the presence of multiple dust
clouds at different distances along each line of sight. This
reddening-based dust map agrees closely with the Schlegel et al. (SFD)
far-infrared emission-based dust map away from the Galactic plane, and
the most prominent differences between the two maps stem from known
limitations of SFD in the plane. We also compare the map with Planck,
finding likewise good agreement in general at high latitudes. The use of
optical data from Pan-STARRS1 yields reddening uncertainty as low as 25
mmag E(B - V).

made separately for each cloud of interest, employing very different
data and techniques. We present a large, homogeneous catalog of
distances to molecular clouds, most of which are of unprecedented
accuracy. We determine distances using optical photometry of stars along
lines of sight toward these clouds, obtained from PanSTARRS-1. We
simultaneously infer the reddenings and distances to these stars,
tracking the full probability distribution function using a technique
presented in Green et al. We fit these star-by-star measurements using a
simple dust screen model to find the distance to each cloud. We thus
estimate the distances to almost all of the clouds in the Magnani et al.
catalog, as well as many other well-studied clouds, including Orion,
Perseus, Taurus, Cepheus, Polaris, California, and Monoceros R2,
avoiding only the inner Galaxy. Typical statistical uncertainties in the
distances are 5\%, though the systematic uncertainty stemming from the
quality of our stellar models is about 10\%. The resulting catalog is the
largest catalog of accurate, directly measured distances to molecular
clouds. Our distance estimates are generally consistent with available
distance estimates from the literature, though in some cases the
literature estimates are off by a factor of more than two.

complexes in the Galaxy. We have developed a new technique for mapping
the three-dimensional distribution of dust in the Galaxy using
Pan-STARRS1 photometry. We isolate the dust at the distance to Orion
using this technique, revealing a large (100 pc, 14{\deg} diameter),
previously unrecognized ring of dust, which we term the ''Orion dust
ring.'' The ring includes Orion A and B, and is not coincident with
current H{$\alpha$} features. The circular morphology suggests formation as
an ancient bubble in the interstellar medium, though we have not been
able to conclusively identify the source of the bubble. This hint at the
history of Orion may have important consequences for models of high-mass
star formation and triggered star formation.

larger sample than in existing detailed studies. We use data from the
APOGEE spectroscopic survey in combination with ten-band photometry from
Pan-STARRS1, the Two Micron All-Sky Survey, and Wide-field Infrared
Survey Explorer. We find that the extinction curve in the optical
through infrared is well characterized by a one-parameter family of
curves described by R(V). The extinction curve is more uniform than
suggested in past works, with {$\sigma$} (R(V))=0.18, and with less than
one percent of sight lines having R(V)$\backslash$gt 4. Our data and analysis have
revealed two new aspects of Galactic extinction: first, we find
significant, wide-area variations in R(V) throughout the Galactic plane.
These variations are on scales much larger than individual molecular
clouds, indicating that R(V) variations must trace much more than just
grain growth in dense molecular environments. Indeed, we find no
correlation between R(V) and dust column density up to E(B-V){\ap} 2.
Second, we discover a strong relationship between R(V) and the
far-infrared dust emissivity.

parameterized by R(V). These measurements revealed structures in R(V)
with large angular scales, which are challenging to explain in existing
dust paradigms. In this work, we combine three-dimensional maps of dust
column density with R(V) measurements to constrain the three-dimensional
distribution of R(V) in the Milky Way. We find that the variations in
R(V) are correlated on kiloparsec scales. In particular, most of the
dust within one kiloparsec in the outer Galaxy, including many local
molecular clouds (Orion, Taurus, Perseus, California, and Cepheus), has
a significantly lower R(V) than more distant dust in the Milky Way.
These results provide new input to models of dust evolution and
processing, and complicate the application of locally derived extinction
curves to more distant regions of the Milky Way and to other galaxies.

  Abstract                 = {{In an era of large spectroscopic surveys of stars and big data,
sophisticated statistical methods become more and more important in
order to infer fundamental stellar parameters such as mass and age.
Bayesian techniques are powerful methods because they can match all
available observables simultaneously to stellar models while taking
prior knowledge properly into account. However, in most cases it is
assumed that observables are uncorrelated which is generally not the
case. Here, we include correlations in the Bayesian code BONNSAI by
incorporating the covariance matrix in the likelihood function. We
derive a parametrisation of the covariance matrix that, in addition to
classical uncertainties, only requires the specification of a
correlation parameter that describes how observables co-vary. Our
correlation parameter depends purely on the method with which
observables have been determined and can be analytically derived in some
cases. This approach therefore has the advantage that correlations can
be accounted for even if information for them are not available in
specific cases but are known in general. Because the new likelihood
model is a better approximation of the data, the reliability and
robustness of the inferred parameters are improved. We find that
neglecting correlations biases the most likely values of inferred
stellar parameters and affects the precision with which these parameters
can be determined. For example, we apply our technique to massive OB
stars, but emphasise that it is valid for any type of stars. For
effective temperatures and surface gravities determined from atmosphere
modelling, we find that masses can be underestimated on average by
$0.5\sigma$ and mass uncertainties overestimated by a factor of about 2
when neglecting correlations. At the same time, the age precisions are
underestimated over a wide range of stellar parameters. [abridged]

  Abstract                 = {{Powerful telescopes equipped with multi-fibre or integral field
spectrographs combined with detailed models of stellar atmospheres and
automated fitting techniques allow for the analysis of large number of
stars. These datasets contain a wealth of information that require new
analysis techniques to bridge the gap between observations and stellar
evolution models. To that end, we develop Bonnsai (BONN Stellar
Astrophysics Interface), a Bayesian statistical method, that is capable
of comparing all available observables simultaneously to stellar models
while taking observed uncertainties and prior knowledge such as initial
mass functions and distributions of stellar rotational velocities into
account. Bonnsai can be used to (1) determine probability distributions
of fundamental stellar parameters such as initial masses and stellar
ages from complex datasets; (2) predict stellar parameters that were not
yet observationally determined; and (3) test stellar models to further
advance our understanding of stellar evolution. An important aspect of
Bonnsai is that it singles out stars that cannot be reproduced by
stellar models through {$\chi$}$^{2}$ hypothesis tests and posterior
predictive checks. Bonnsai can be used with any set of stellar models
and currently supports massive main-sequence single star models of Milky
Way and Large and Small Magellanic Cloud composition. We apply our new
method to mock stars to demonstrate its functionality and capabilities.
In a first application, we use Bonnsai to test the stellar models of
Brott et al. (2011, A{\amp}A, 530, A115) by comparing the stellar ages
inferred for the primary and secondary stars of eclipsing Milky Way
binaries of which the components range in mass between 4.5 and 28
M$_{&sun;}$. Ages are determined from dynamical masses and radii
that are known to better than 3\%. We show that the stellar models must
include rotation because stellar radii can be increased by several
percent via centrifugal forces. We find that the average age difference
between the primary and secondary stars of the binaries is 0.9 {\plusmn}
2.3 Myr (95\% CI), i.e. that the stellar models reproduce the Milky Way
binaries well. The predicted effective temperatures are in agreement for
observed effective temperatures for stars cooler than 25 000 K. In
hotter stars, i.e. stars earlier than B1-2V and more massive than about
10 M$_{&sun;}$, we find that the observed effective temperatures
are on average hotter by 1.1 {\plusmn} 0.3 kK (95\% CI) and the bolometric
luminosities are consequently larger by 0.06 {\plusmn} 0.02 dex (95\% CI)
than predicted by the stellar models.

  Abstract                 = {{AIMS: In their 1st extension to the Milky Way Star Clusters (MWSC)
survey, Schmeja et al. applied photometric filters to the 2MASS to find
new cluster candidates that were subsequently confirmed or rejected by
the MWSC pipeline. To further extend the MWSC census, we aimed at
discovering new clusters by conducting an almost global search in proper
motion catalogues as a starting point. METHODS: We first selected
high-quality samples from the PPMXL and UCAC4 for comparison and
verification of the proper motions. For 441 circular proper motion bins
(radius 15 mas/yr) within \$$\backslash$pm\$50 mas/yr, the sky outside a thin
Galactic plane zone (\$|b|\$\${\lt}\$5\$\^{}$\{$$\backslash$circ$\}$\$) was binned in small areas
('sky pixels') of 0.25\$$\backslash$times\$0.25 deg\$\^{}2\$. Sky pixels with enhanced
numbers of stars with a certain common proper motion in both catalogues
were considered as cluster candidates. After visual inspection of the
sky images, we built an automated procedure that combined these
representations of the sky for neighbouring proper motion subsamples
after a background correction. RESULTS: About half of our 692 candidates
overlapped with known clusters (46 globular and 68 open clusters in the
Galaxy, about 150 known clusters of galaxies) or the Magellanic Clouds.
About 10\% of our candidates turned out to be 63 new open clusters
confirmed by the MWSC pipeline. They occupy predominantly the two inner
Galactic quadrants and have apparent sizes and numbers of high-probable
members slightly larger than those of the typically small MWSC clusters,
whereas their other parameters (ages, distances, tidal radii) fall in
the typical ranges. As our search aimed at finding compact clusters, we
did not find new very nearby (extended) clusters. (abridged)

evolution studies because of extreme extinction and stellar crowding.
Large, near-IR spectroscopic surveys, such as the Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), for the first time
allow the measurement of metallicities in the inner region of our
Galaxy. We study metallicities of 33 K/M giants situated in the Galactic
center region from observations obtained with the APOGEE survey. We
selected K/M giants with reliable stellar parameters from the
APOGEE/ASPCAP pipeline. Distances, interstellar extinction values, and
radial velocities were checked to confirm that these stars are indeed
situated in the inner Galactic bulge. We find a metal-rich population
centered at [M/H] = +0.4 dex, in agreement with earlier studies of other
bulge regions, but we also discovered a peak at low metallicity around
[M/H] = -1.0 dex. This finding suggests the presence of a metal-poor
population, which has not previously been detected in the central
region. Our results indicate a dominant metal-rich population with a
metal-poor component that is enhanced in the {$\alpha$}-elements. This
metal-poor population may be associated with the classical bulge and a
fast formation scenario.

  Abstract                 = {{The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) began
observations in July 2014. It pursues three core programs: APOGEE-2,
MaNGA, and eBOSS. In addition, eBOSS contains two major subprograms:
TDSS and SPIDERS. This paper describes the first data release from
SDSS-IV, Data Release 13 (DR13), which contains new data, reanalysis of
existing data sets and, like all SDSS data releases, is inclusive of
previously released data. DR13 makes publicly available 1390 spatially
resolved integral field unit observations of nearby galaxies from MaNGA,
the first data released from this survey. It includes new observations
from eBOSS, completing SEQUELS. In addition to targeting galaxies and
quasars, SEQUELS also targeted variability-selected objects from TDSS
and X-ray selected objects from SPIDERS. DR13 includes new reductions of
the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric calibration and
redshift classification. DR13 releases new reductions of the APOGEE-1
data from SDSS-III, with abundances of elements not previously included
and improved stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. For
the SDSS imaging data, DR13 provides new, more robust and precise
photometric calibrations. Several value-added catalogs are being
released in tandem with DR13, in particular target catalogs relevant for
eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS, and an updated red-clump catalog for APOGEE.
This paper describes the location and format of the data now publicly
available, as well as providing references to the important technical
papers that describe the targeting, observing, and data reduction. The
SDSS website, http://www.sdss.org, provides links to the data, tutorials
and examples of data access, and extensive documentation of the
reduction and analysis procedures. DR13 is the first of a scheduled set
that will contain new data and analyses from the planned \~{}6-year
operations of SDSS-IV.

  Abstract                 = {{Pulsating stars, such as Cepheids, Miras, and RR Lyrae stars, are
important distance indicators and calibrators of the ''cosmic distance
ladder'', and yet their period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations are
still constrained using simple statistical methods that cannot take full
advantage of available data. To enable optimal usage of data provided by
the Gaia mission, we present a probabilistic approach that
simultaneously constrains parameters of PLZ relations and uncertainties
in Gaia parallax measurements. We demonstrate this approach by
constraining PLZ relations of RR Lyrae stars in near-infrared W1 and W2
bands, using Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) parallax
measurements for a sample of 123 RR Lyrae stars located within 2.5 kpc
of the Sun. The fitted PLZ relations are consistent with previous
studies, and in combination with other data, deliver distances precise
to 6\% (once various sources of uncertainty are taken into account). To a
precision of 0.03 mas ($1\sigma$), we do not find a statistically
significant offset in TGAS parallaxes for this sample of distant RR
Lyrae stars (median parallax of 0.8 mas and distance of 1.4 kpc). With
only minor modifications, our probabilistic approach can be used to
constrain PLZ relations of other pulsating stars, and we intend to apply
it to Cepheid and Mira stars in the near future.

age-sensitive asteroseismic information for tens of thousands of red
giants. This provides a promising opportunity to study the Galactic
structure and evolution. We use asteroseismic data of red giants,
observed by Kepler, to test the current theoretical framework of
modeling the Galaxy based on population synthesis modeling and the use
of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants. We use the open source
code Galaxia to model the Milky Way and find the distribution of the
masses predicted by Galaxia to be systematically offset with respect to
the seismically inferred observed masses. The Galactic model
overestimates the number of low-mass stars, and these stars are
predominantly old and of low metallicity. Using corrections to the
$\{$$\{${$\Delta$} $\}$$\}${$\nu$} scaling relation suggested by stellar models
significantly reduces the disagreement between predicted and observed
masses. For a few cases where non-seismic mass estimates are available,
the corrections to $\{$$\{${$\Delta$} $\}$$\}${$\nu$} also improve the agreement between
seismic and non-seismic mass estimates. The disagreement between
predictions of the Galactic model and the observations is most
pronounced for stars with $\{$$\{$[Fe/H]$\}$$\}$$\backslash$lt -0.5 and $\{$$\{$[Fe/H]$\}$$\}$$\backslash$gt 0 or for
$\{$T$\}$$_{{{eff}$$\}$$\}$$\backslash$gt 4700 K. Altering the star formation rate in
order to suppress stars older than 10 Gyr improves the agreement for
mass but leads to inconsistent color distributions. We also tested the
predictions of the TRILEGAL Galactic model. However, unlike Galaxia, it
had difficulties in reproducing the photometric properties of the Kepler
Input Catalog because it overestimates the number of blue stars. We
conclude that either the scaling relations and/or the Galactic models
need to be revised to reconcile predictions of theory with asteroseismic
observations.

  Abstract                 = {{The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will provide high
precision time-series photometry for millions of stars with at least a
half-hour cadence. Of particular interest are the circular regions of
12-degree radius centered around the ecliptic poles that will be
observed continuously for a full year. Spectroscopic stellar parameters
are desirable to characterize and select suitable targets for TESS,
whether they are focused on exploring exoplanets, stellar astrophysics,
or Galactic archaeology. Here, we present spectroscopic stellar
parameters ($T\_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], $v \sin i$, $v\_{\rm
micro}$) for about 16,000 dwarf and subgiant stars in TESS' southern
continuous viewing zone. For almost all the stars, we also present
Bayesian estimates of stellar properties including distance, extinction,
mass, radius, and age using theoretical isochrones. Stellar surface
gravity and radius are made available for an additional set of roughly
8,500 red giants. All our target stars are in the range
$10\ltV\lt13.1$. Among them, we identify and list 227 stars belonging
to the Large Magellanic Cloud. The data were taken using the the High
Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph (HERMES, R $\sim
28,000$) at the Anglo-Australian Telescope as part of the TESS-HERMES
survey. Comparing our results with the TESS Input Catalog (TIC) shows
that the TIC is generally efficient in separating dwarfs and giants, but
it has flagged more than hundred cool dwarfs ($T\_{\rm eff}\lt 4800$ K)
as giants, which ought to be high-priority targets for the exoplanet
search. The catalog can be accessed via

were measured using radio and optical spectroscopy. Accurate electron
temperatures in 67 H II regions spanning the range R$_{G}$ =
3.5-13.7 kpc were determined using radio recombination lines and these
temperatures were applied to optical spectra of 33 of the same H II
regions in order to determine the abundances of O, N, S, Ne, Ar, and
He(+). Among other results, it is found that some H II regions have
electron temperatures below 5000 K and that the radio-determined
electron temperatures agree well with those obtained from the optical
line ratios, in the light of standard models of H II regions. A gradient
of H II region electron temperature with distance from the galactic
center is found which equals +433 + or - 40 K/kpc, while the oxygen
abundance gradient is -0.07 + or - 0.015 dex/kpc. The nitrogen abundance
gradient is similar to that of oxygen, -0.09 + or 0.015 dex/kpc, while
the sulfur abundance gradient (-0.01 + or - 0.02 dex/kpc) is
significantly flatter than that of oxygen. No significant gradient in
He(+)/H(+) is detected. In addition, evidence indicates that the
abundance gradients may be steeper over the inner regions of the
galactic disk.

  Abstract                 = {{Near infrared images from the COBE satellite presented the first clear
evidence that our Milky Way galaxy contains a boxy shaped bulge. Recent
years have witnessed a gradual paradigm shift in the formation and
evolution of the Galactic bulge. Bulges were commonly believed to form
in the dynamical violence of galaxy mergers. However, it has become
increasingly clear that the main body of the Milky Way bulge is not a
classical bulge made by previous major mergers, instead it appears to be
a bar seen somewhat end-on. The Milky Way bar can form naturally from a
precursor disc and thicken vertically by the internal firehose/buckling
instability, giving rise to the boxy appearance. This picture is
supported by many lines of evidence, including the asymmetric
parallelogram shape, the strong cylindrical rotation (i.e., nearly
constant rotation regardless of the height above the disc plane), the
existence of an intriguing X-shaped structure in the bulge, and perhaps
the metallicity gradients. We review the major theoretical models and
techniques to understand the Milky Way bulge. Despite the progresses in
recent theoretical attempts, a complete bulge formation model that
explains the full kinematics and metallicity distribution is still not
fully understood. Upcoming large surveys are expected to shed new light
on the formation history of the Galactic bulge.

inclination of . We compare this value to computed inclinations for two
mass models of the Milky Way. We find that our measurement is consistent
with a short scalelength of the stellar disc (R$_{d}$ \~{}= 2 kpc) if
the dark halo is oblate or with a long scalelength (R$_{d}$ \~{}= 3
kpc) if the dark halo is prolate. Once combined with independent
constraints on the flattening of the halo, our measurement suggests that
the scalelength is approximately halfway between these two extreme
values, with a preferred range 2.5-2.7 kpc for a nearly spherical halo.
Nevertheless, no model can be clearly ruled out. With the continuation
of the RAVE survey, it will be possible to provide a strong constraint
on the mass distribution of the Milky Way using refined measurements of
the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. The overall evolution of low-mass stars is heavily influenced
by the processes occurring in the stellar interior. In particular,
mixing processes in convectively unstable zones and overshooting regions
affect the resulting observables and main sequence lifetime. <BR />
Aims: We aim to study the effects of different convective boundary
definitions and mixing prescriptions in convective cores of low-mass
stars and to distinguish the existence, size, and evolutionary stage of
the central mixed zone by means of asteroseismology. <BR /> Methods: We
implemented the Ledoux criterion for convection in our stellar evolution
code, together with a time-dependent diffusive approach for mixing of
elements when semiconvective zones are present. We compared models with
masses ranging from 1.1 M$_{&sun;}$ to 2 M$_{&sun;}$
computed with two different criteria for convective boundary definition
and included different mixing prescriptions within and beyond the formal
limits of the convective regions. Using calculations of adiabatic
oscillations frequencies for a large set of models, we developed an
asteroseismic diagnosis using only l = 0 and l = 1 modes based on the
ratios of small to large separations r$_{01}$ and r$_{10}$
defined by Roxburgh {\amp} Vorontsov (2003, A{\amp}A, 411, 215). We
analyzed the sensitivity of this seismic tool to the central conditions
of the star during the main sequence evolution. <BR /> Results: The
seismic variables r$_{01}$ and r$_{10}$ are almost linear in
the expected observable frequency range, and we show that their slope
depends simultaneously on the central hydrogen content, the extent of
the convective core, and the amplitude of the sound-speed discontinuity
at the core boundary. By considering about 25 modes and an accuracy in
the frequency determinations as expected from the CoRoT and Kepler
missions, the technique we propose allows us to detect the presence of a
convective core and to discriminate the different sizes of the
homogeneously mixed central region without the need for a strong prior
knowledge on the stellar mass.

  Abstract                 = {{Asteroseismology of solar-type stars has entered a new era of large
surveys with the success of the NASA Kepler mission, which is providing
exquisite data on oscillations of stars across the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram. From the time-series photometry, the two seismic parameters
that can be most readily extracted are the large frequency separation
({$\Delta$}{$\nu$}) and the frequency of maximum oscillation power
({$\nu$}$_{max}$). After the survey phase, these quantities are
available for hundreds of solar-type stars. By scaling from solar
values, we use these two asteroseismic observables to identify for the
first time an evolutionary sequence of 1 M $_{sun}$ field stars,
without the need for further information from stellar models. Comparison
of our determinations with the few available spectroscopic results shows
an excellent level of agreement. We discuss the potential of the method
for differential analysis throughout the main-sequence evolution and the
possibility of detecting twins of very well-known stars.

  Abstract                 = {{We present a study of 33 Kepler planet-candidate host stars for which
asteroseismic observations have sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio
to allow extraction of individual pulsation frequencies. We implement a
new Bayesian scheme that is flexible in its input to process individual
oscillation frequencies, combinations of them, and average asteroseismic
parameters, and derive robust fundamental properties for these targets.
Applying this scheme to grids of evolutionary models yields stellar
properties with median statistical uncertainties of 1.2 per cent
(radius), 1.7 per cent (density), 3.3 per cent (mass), 4.4 per cent
(distance), and 14 per cent (age), making this the exoplanet host-star
sample with the most precise and uniformly determined fundamental
parameters to date. We assess the systematics from changes in the solar
abundances and mixing-length parameter, showing that they are smaller
than the statistical errors. We also determine the stellar properties
with three other fitting algorithms and explore the systematics arising
from using different evolution and pulsation codes, resulting in 1 per
cent in density and radius, and 2 per cent and 7 per cent in mass and
age, respectively. We confirm previous findings of the initial helium
abundance being a source of systematics comparable to our statistical
uncertainties, and discuss future prospects for constraining this
parameter by combining asteroseismology and data from space missions.
Finally, we compare our derived properties with those obtained using the
global average asteroseismic observables along with effective
temperature and metallicity, finding excellent level of agreement. Owing
to selection effects, our results show that the majority of the high
signal-to-noise ratio asteroseismic Kepler host stars are older than the
Sun.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. The origin and site(s) of the r-process nucleosynthesis is(are)
still not known with certainty, but complete, detailed r-element
abundances offer our best clues. The few extremely metal-poor (EMP)
stars with large r-element excesses allow us to study the r-process
signatures in great detail, with minimal interference from later stages
of Galactic evolution. CS 31082-001 is an outstanding example of the
information that can be gathered from these exceptional stars. <BR />
Aims: Here we aim to complement our previous abundance determinations
for third-peak r-process elements with new and improved results for
elements of the first and second r-process peaks from near-UV HST/STIS
and optical UVES spectra. These results should provide new insight into
the nucleosynthesis of the elements beyond iron. <BR /> Methods: The
spectra were analyzed by a consistent approach based on an OSMARCS LTE
model atmosphere and the Turbospectrum spectrum synthesis code to derive
abundances of heavy elements in CS 31082-001, and using updated
oscillator strengths from the recent literature. Synthetic spectra were
computed for all lines of the elements of interest to check for proper
line intensities and possible blends in these crowded spectra. Our new
abundances were combined with the best previous results to provide
reliable mean abundances for the first and second-peak r-process
elements. <BR /> Results: We present new abundances for 23
neutron-capture elements, 6 of which - Ge, Mo, Lu, Ta, W, and Re - have
not been reported before. This makes CS 31082-001 the most completely
studied r-II star, with abundances for a total of 37 neutron-capture
elements. We also present the first NLTE+3D abundance of lead in this
star, further constraining the nature of the r-process.

  Abstract                 = {{We present the design and performance of the multi-object fiber
spectrographs for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and their upgrade
for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Originally
commissioned in Fall 1999 on the 2.5 m aperture Sloan Telescope at
Apache Point Observatory, the spectrographs produced more than 1.5
million spectra for the SDSS and SDSS-II surveys, enabling a wide
variety of Galactic and extra-galactic science including the first
observation of baryon acoustic oscillations in 2005. The spectrographs
were upgraded in 2009 and are currently in use for BOSS, the flagship
survey of the third-generation SDSS-III project. BOSS will measure
redshifts of 1.35 million massive galaxies to redshift 0.7 and Ly{$\alpha$}
absorption of 160,000 high redshift quasars over 10,000 deg$^{2}$
of sky, making percent level measurements of the absolute cosmic
distance scale of the universe and placing tight constraints on the
equation of state of dark energy. The twin multi-object fiber
spectrographs utilize a simple optical layout with reflective
collimators, gratings, all-refractive cameras, and state-of-the-art CCD
detectors to produce hundreds of spectra simultaneously in two channels
over a bandpass covering the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, with
a resolving power R = {$\lambda$}/FWHM \~{} 2000. Building on proven heritage,
the spectrographs were upgraded for BOSS with volume-phase holographic
gratings and modern CCD detectors, improving the peak throughput by
nearly a factor of two, extending the bandpass to cover 360 nm {\lt}
{$\lambda$} {\lt} 1000 nm, and increasing the number of fibers from 640 to
1000 per exposure. In this paper we describe the original SDSS
spectrograph design and the upgrades implemented for BOSS, and document
the predicted and measured performances.

Our modelling takes into account the uncertainties in the chemical and kinematic properties. We make use of RAVE DR5 radial velocities and abundances together with Gaia DR1 proper motions and parallaxes (when possible, otherwise UCAC4 data is used). We found that, in general, the velocity dispersions increase with decreasing [Fe/H] and increasing [Mg/Fe]. A possible decrease in velocity dispersion for stars with high [Mg/Fe] is a property of a negligible fraction of stars and hardly a robust result. At low [Fe/H] and high [Mg/Fe] the sample is incomplete, affected by biases, and likely not representative of the underlying stellar population.},

the Orion association before its supernova explosion, as an OB runaway
star in which case the supernova could have occurred some distance away
from the association. We also point out that if the supernova occurred
in the association itself, the most likely region might be within the
lambda Ori association.

Galactic globular clusters (M3, M53, M71, M92, and NGC 5053) and three
open clusters (M35, NGC 2158, and NGC 6791) are processed by the current
version of the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline (SSPP), in order to
determine estimates of metallicities and radial velocities (RVs) for the
clusters. These results are then compared to values from the literature.
We find that the mean metallicity (lang[Fe/H]rang) and mean radial
velocity (langRVrang) estimates for each cluster are almost all within
2{$\sigma$} of the adopted literature values; most are within 1{$\sigma$}. We
also demonstrate that the new version of the SSPP achieves small, but
noteworthy, improvements in lang[Fe/H]rang estimates at the extrema of
the cluster metallicity range, as compared to a previous version of the
pipeline software. These results provide additional confidence in the
application of the SSPP for studies of the abundances and kinematics of
stellar populations in the Galaxy.

of local giants, within 100 pc, with atmospheric parameters either
estimated from our spectroscopic observations at high resolution and
high signal-to-noise ratio, or retrieved from the literature. The other
part of the sample includes 523 distant stars, spanning distances up to
1 kpc in the direction of the North Galactic Pole, for which we have
estimated atmospheric parameters from high resolution but low
signal-to-noise Echelle spectra. This new sample is kinematically
unbiased, with well-defined boundaries in magnitude and colours. We
revisit the basic properties of the Galactic thin disk as traced by
clump giants. We find the metallicity distribution to be different from
that of dwarfs, with fewer metal-rich stars. We find evidence for a
vertical metallicity gradient of -0.31 dex kpc$^{-1}$ and for a
transition at \~{}4-5 Gyr in both the metallicity and velocities. The
age-metallicity relation (AMR), which exhibits a very low dispersion,
increases smoothly from 10 to 4 Gyr, with a steeper increase for younger
stars. The age-velocity relation (AVR) is characterized by the
saturation of the V and W dispersions at 5 Gyr, and continuous heating
in U.

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: We present a new upgraded version of ARES. The new version
includes a series of interesting new features such as automatic radial
velocity correction, a fully automatic continuum determination, and an
estimation of the errors for the equivalent widths. <BR /> Methods: The
automatic correction of the radial velocity is achieved with a simple
cross-correlation function, and the automatic continuum determination,
as well as the estimation of the errors, relies on a new approach to
evaluating the spectral noise at the continuum level. <BR /> Results:
ARES v2 is totally compatible with its predecessor. We show that the
fully automatic continuum determination is consistent with the previous
methods applied for this task. It also presents a significant
improvement on its performance thanks to the implementation of a
parallel computation using the OpenMP library.

  Abstract                 = {{NGC 2420 is a {\tilde}2 Gyr old well-populated open cluster that lies about
2 kpc beyond the solar circle, in the general direction of the Galactic
anti-center. Most previous abundance studies have found this cluster to
be mildly metal-poor, but with a large scatter in the obtained
metallicities. Detailed chemical abundance distributions are derived for
12 red-giant members of NGC 2420 via a manual abundance analysis of
high-resolution (R = 22,500) near-infrared ({$\lambda$}1.5-1.7 {$\mu$}m)
spectra obtained from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution
Experiment (APOGEE) survey. The sample analyzed contains six stars that
are identified as members of the first-ascent red giant branch (RGB), as
well as six members of the red clump (RC). We find small scatter in the
star-to-star abundances in NGC 2420, with a mean cluster abundance of
[Fe/H] = -0.16 {\plusmn} 0.04 for the 12 red giants. The internal
abundance dispersion for all elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca,
Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co and Ni) is also very small ({\tilde}0.03-0.06 dex),
indicating a uniform cluster abundance distribution within the
uncertainties. NGC 2420 is one of the clusters used to calibrate the
APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundance Pipeline (ASPCAP). The
results from this manual analysis compare well with ASPCAP abundances
for most of the elements studied, although for Na, Al, and V there are
more significant offsets. No evidence of extra-mixing at the RGB
luminosity bump is found in the $^{12}$C and $^{14}$N
abundances from the pre-luminosity-bump RGB stars in comparison to the
post-He core-flash RC stars.

  Abstract                 = {{The radial metallicity distribution in the Galactic thin disc represents
a crucial constraint for modelling disc formation and evolution. Open
clusters allow us to derive both the radial metallicity distribution and
its evolution over time. In this paper we perform the first
investigation of the present-day radial metallicity distribution based
on [Fe/H] determinations in late type members of pre-main-sequence
clusters. Because of their youth, these clusters are therefore essential
for tracing the current inter-stellar medium metallicity. We used the
products of the Gaia-ESO Survey analysis of 12 young regions (age$\lt$100
Myr), covering Galactocentric distances from 6.67 to 8.70 kpc. For the
first time, we derived the metal content of star forming regions farther
than 500 pc from the Sun. Median metallicities were determined through
samples of reliable cluster members. For ten clusters the membership
analysis is discussed in the present paper, while for other two clusters
(Chamaeleon I and Gamma Velorum) we adopted the members identified in
our previous works. All the pre-main-sequence clusters considered in
this paper have close-to-solar or slightly sub-solar metallicities. The
radial metallicity distribution traced by these clusters is almost flat,
with the innermost star forming regions having [Fe/H] values that are
0.10-0.15 dex lower than the majority of the older clusters located at
similar Galactocentric radii. This homogeneous study of the present-day
radial metallicity distribution in the Galactic thin disc favours models
that predict a flattening of the radial gradient over time. On the other
hand, the decrease of the average [Fe/H] at young ages is not easily
explained by the models. Our results reveal a complex interplay of
several processes (e.g. star formation activity, initial mass function,
supernova yields, gas flows) that controlled the recent evolution of the
Milky Way.

progeny of stars with main-sequence mass greater than 3

$_{sun}$ mass stars, corresponding to a wide range of progenitor
ages, and thus are essential probes of the chemical evolution of
galaxies, and indispensable to constrain the results from chemical
models. We use an extended and homogeneous data set of Galactic PNe to
study the metallicity gradients and the Galactic structure and
evolution. The most up-to-date abundances, distances (calibrated with
Magellanic Cloud PNe), and other parameters have been employed, together
with a novel homogeneous morphological classification, to characterize
the different PN populations. We confirm that morphological classes have
a strong correlation with Peimbert's type PN, and also with their
distribution on the Galactic landscape. We studied the {$\alpha$}-element
distribution within the Galactic disk, and found that the best selected
disk population (i.e., excluding bulge and halo component), together
with the most reliable PN distance scale yields to a radial oxygen
gradient of {$\Delta$}log(O/H)/{$\Delta$}R $_{G}$ = -0.023 {\plusmn}
0.006 dex kpc$^{-1}$ for the whole disk sample, and of
{$\Delta$}log(O/H)/{$\Delta$}R $_{G}$ = -0.035 {\plusmn} 0.024, -0.023
{\plusmn} 0.005, and -0.011 {\plusmn} 0.013 dex kpc$^{-1}$,
respectively for Type I, II, and III PNe, i.e., for high-,
intermediate-, and low-mass progenitors. Neon gradients for the same PN
types confirm the trend. Accurate statistical analysis shows moderately
high uncertainties in the slopes, but also confirms the trend of steeper
gradient for PNe with more massive progenitors, indicating a possible
steepening with time of the Galactic disk metallicity gradient for what
the {$\alpha$}-elements are concerned. We found that the metallicity
gradients are almost independent on the distance scale model used, as
long as these scales are equally well calibrated with the Magellanic
Clouds. The PN metallicity gradients presented here are consistent with
the local metallicity distribution; furthermore, oxygen gradients
determined with young and intermediate age PNe show good consistency
with oxygen gradients derived respectively from other young (OB stars, H
II regions) and intermediate (open cluster) Galactic populations. We
also extend the Galactic metallicity gradient comparison by revisiting
the open cluster [Fe/H] data from high resolution spectroscopy. The
analysis suggests that they could be compliant with the same general
picture of a steepening of gradient with time.

gradients. We used the strong-line method to derive oxygen abundances
from spectra acquired with GMOS-S, the multi-object spectrograph on the
8 m Gemini South telescope. We found that NGC 7793 has a well-defined
gas-phase radial oxygen gradient of -0.321 {\plusmn} 0.112 dex

kpc$^{-1}$) in the galactocentric range 0.17 $\lt$
R$_{G}$/R$_{25}$ $\lt$ 0.82, not dissimilar from gradients
calculated with direct abundance methods in galaxies of similar mass and
morphology. We also determined a shallow radial oxygen gradient in NGC
4945, -0.253 {\plusmn} 0.149 dex $\{$R$\}$$_{25}$$^{-1}$ (or
-0.019 {\plusmn} 0.011 dex kpc$^{-1}$) for 0.04 $\lt$
R$_{G}$/R$_{25}$ $\lt$ 0.51, where the larger relative
uncertainty derives mostly from the larger inclination of this galaxy.
NGC 7793 and NGC 4945 have been selected for this study because they are
similar, in mass and morphology, to M33 and the Milky Way, respectively.
Since at zeroth order we expect the radial metallicity gradients to
depend on mass and galaxy type, we compared our galaxies in the
framework of radial metallicity models best suited for M33 and the
Galaxy. We found a good agreement between M33 and NGC 7793, pointing
toward similar evolution for the two galaxies. We notice instead
differences between NGC 4945 and the radial metallicity gradient model
that best fits the Milky Way. We found that these differences are likely
related to the presence of an active galactic nucleus combined with a
bar in the central regions of NGC 4945, and to its interacting
environment.

  Abstract                 = {{<BR /> Aims: We present a new set of weak-line abundances of HII regions
in M 81, which are based on Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS)
observations. The aim is to derive plasma and abundance analysis for a
sizable set of emission-line targets to study the galactic chemical
contents in the framework of galactic metallicity gradients. <BR />
Methods: We used the weak-line abundance approach by deriving electron
density and temperatures for several HII regions in M 81. Our gradient
analysis is based on oxygen abundances. <BR /> Results: Together with a
set of HII region abundances determined similarly by us with
Multi-Mirror Telescope (MMT) spectra, the new data yield a radial oxygen
gradient of -0.088 {\plusmn} 0.013 dex kpc$^{-1}$, which is steeper
than the metallicity gradient obtained for planetary nebulae (-0.044
{\plusmn} 0.007 dex kpc$^{-1}$). This result could be interpreted
as gradient evolution with time: Models of galactic evolution with
inside-out disk formation associated to pre-enriched gas infall would
produce such a difference in gradients, although stellar migration
effects would also induce a difference in the metallicity gradients
between the old and young populations. <BR /> Conclusions: By comparing
the M 81 metallicity gradients with those of other spiral galaxies,
which were all consistently derived from weak-line analysis, we can
infer that a similar gradient difference is common among spirals. The
metallicity gradient slopes for HII regions and PNe seem to be steeper
in M 81 than in other galactic disks, which is probably because M 81
belongs to a galaxy group. We also found that M 81 has experienced an
average oxygen enrichment of 0.14 {\plusmn} 0.08 dex in the spatial
domain defined by the observations. Our data are compatible with a break
in the radial oxygen gradient slope around R$_{25}$ as inferred by
other authors both in M 81 and in other galaxies.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. M 81 is an ideal laboratory to investigate the galactic
chemical and dynamical evolution through the study of its young and old
stellar populations. <BR /> Aims: We analyze the chemical abundances of
planetary nebulae and H ii regions in the M 81 disk for insight on
galactic evolution, and compare it with that of other galaxies,
including the Milky Way. <BR /> Methods: We acquired Hectospec/MMT
spectra of 39 PNe and 20 H ii regions, with 33 spectra viable for
temperature and abundance analysis. Our PN observations represent the
first PN spectra in M 81 ever published, while several H ii region
spectra have been published before, although without a direct electron
temperature determination. We determine elemental abundances of helium,
nitrogen, oxygen, neon, sulfur, and argon in PNe and H ii regions, and
determine their averages and radial gradients. <BR /> Results: The
average O/H ratio of PNe compared to that of the H ii regions indicates
a general oxygen enrichment in M 81 in the last \~{}10 Gyr. The PN
metallicity gradient in the disk of M 81 is
{$\Delta$}log(O/H)/{$\Delta$}R$_{G}$ = -0.055 {\plusmn} 0.02 dex/kpc.
Neon and sulfur in PNe have a radial distribution similar to that of
oxygen, with similar gradient slopes. If we combine our H ii sample with
the one in the literature we find a possible mild evolution of the
gradient slope, with results consistent with gradient steepening with
time. Additional spectroscopy is needed to confirm this trend. There are
no type I PNe in our M 81 sample, consistently with the observation of
only the brightest bins of the PNLF, the galaxy metallicity, and the
evolution of post-AGB shells. <BR /> Conclusions: Both the young and the
old populations of M 81 disclose shallow but detectable negative radial
metallicity gradient, which could be slightly steeper for the young
population, thus not excluding a mild gradients steepening with the time
since galaxy formation. During its evolution M 81 has been producing
oxygen; its total oxygen enrichment exceeds that of other nearby
galaxies.

solar, the computed abundances deviate systematically from the real
ones, generally by larger amounts for more metal-rich H ii regions. We
discuss the reasons for this, and present diagrams allowing the reader
to better understand the various factors coming into play. We briefly
discuss less classical methods to derive abundances in metal-rich H ii
regions. In particular, we comment on the interest of the oxygen and
carbon recombination lines. We also show that, contrary to the case of
giant H ii regions, the physical conditions in bright extragalactic
planetary nebulae are such that their chemical composition can be
accurately derived even at high metallicities. Thus, extragalactic
planetary nebulae are promising potential probes of the metallicity of
the interstellar medium in the internal parts of spiral galaxies as well
as in metal-rich elliptical galaxies.

stellar radii, effective temperatures, and in many cases metallicities
previously determined in the literature, and thus have bolometric
luminosities that are typically good to {\lsim}10\%. In most cases the
available broadband photometry spans a wavelength range 0.4-10
{$\mu$}m, and in many cases spans 0.15-22 {$\mu$}m. The resulting SED
fits, which have only extinction as a free parameter, provide a
virtually model-independent measure of the bolometric flux at Earth. The
SED fits are satisfactory for 156 of the EBs, for which we achieve
typical precisions in the bolometric flux of {\ap}3\%. Combined with the
accurately known bolometric luminosity, the result for each EB is a
predicted parallax that is typically precise to {\lsim}5\%. These
predicted parallaxes{\mdash}with typical uncertainties of 200
{$\mu$}as{\mdash}are 4-5 times more precise than those determined by
Hipparcos for 99 of the EBs in our sample, with which we find excellent
agreement. There is no evidence among this sample for significant
systematics in the Hipparcos parallaxes of the sort that notoriously
afflicted the Pleiades measurement. The EBs are distributed over the
entire sky, span more than 10 mag in brightness, reach distances of more
than 5 kpc, and in many cases our predicted parallaxes should also be
more precise than those expected from the Gaia first data release. The
EBs studied here can thus serve as empirical, independent benchmarks for
these upcoming fundamental parallax measurements.

offset is -0.38 {\plusmn} 0.06 mas in the ecliptic north and
-0.05 {\plusmn} 0.09 mas in the ecliptic south. The ecliptic

parallax offset on distance, with the offset becoming negligible for

systematic error in the eclipsing binary distance scale, and reject this
interpretation as unlikely.

  Abstract                 = {{Asteroseismology of stars in clusters has been a long-sought goal
because the assumption of a common age, distance, and initial chemical
composition allows strong tests of the theory of stellar evolution. We
report results from the first 34 days of science data from the Kepler
Mission for the open cluster NGC 6819{\mdash}one of the four clusters in
the field of view. We obtain the first clear detections of solar-like
oscillations in the cluster red giants and are able to measure the large
frequency separation, {$\Delta$}{$\nu$}, and the frequency of maximum
oscillation power, {$\nu$}$_{max}$. We find that the asteroseismic
parameters allow us to test cluster membership of the stars, and even
with the limited seismic data in hand, we can already identify four
possible non-members despite their having a better than 80\% membership
probability from radial velocity measurements. We are also able to
determine the oscillation amplitudes for stars that span about 2 orders
of magnitude in luminosity and find good agreement with the prediction
that oscillation amplitudes scale as the luminosity to the power of 0.7.
These early results demonstrate the unique potential of asteroseismology
of the stellar clusters observed by Kepler.

  Abstract                 = {{NASA{\rsquo}s re-purposed Kepler mission{\mdash}dubbed K2{\mdash}has
brought new scientific opportunities that were not anticipated for the
original Kepler mission. One science goal that makes optimal use of K2's
capabilities, in particular its 360{\deg} ecliptic field of view, is
galactic archaeology{\mdash}the study of the evolution of the Galaxy from
the fossil stellar record. The thrust of this research is to exploit
high-precision, time-resolved photometry from K2 in order to detect
oscillations in red giant stars. This asteroseismic information can
provide estimates of stellar radius (hence distance), mass, and age of
vast numbers of stars across the Galaxy. Here we present the initial
analysis of a subset of red giants, observed toward the north galactic
gap, during the mission{\rsquo}s first full science campaign. We
investigate the feasibility of using K2 data for detecting oscillations
in red giants that span a range in apparent magnitude and evolutionary
state (hence intrinsic luminosity). We demonstrate that oscillations are
detectable for essentially all cool giants within the $\{$log$\}$g range
{\tilde}1.9-3.2. Our detection is complete down to $\{$$\backslash$text$\{$Kp$\}$$\}$ {\tilde} 
14.5, which results in a seismic sample with little or no detection
bias. This sample is ideally suited to stellar population studies that
seek to investigate potential shortcomings of contemporary Galaxy
models.

constraining the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Milky Way. This
paper presents the methodology and considerations that drive the
selection of the targeted, allocated and successfully observed Milky Way
field stars. The detailed understanding of the survey construction,
specifically the influence of target selection criteria on observed
Milky Way field stars is required in order to analyse and interpret the
survey data correctly. We present the target selection process for the
Milky Way field stars observed with Very Large Telescope/Fibre Large
Array Multi Element Spectrograph and provide the weights that
characterize the survey target selection. The weights can be used to
account for the selection effects in the Gaia-ESO Survey data for
scientific studies. We provide a couple of simple examples to highlight
the necessity of including such information in studies of the stellar
populations in the Milky Way.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Carbon, oxygen and nitrogen (CNO) are key elements in stellar
formation and evolution, and their abundances should also have a
significant impact on planetary formation and evolution. <BR /> Aims: We
aim to present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of 1110 solar-type
stars, 143 of which are known to have planetary companions. We have
determined the carbon abundances of these stars and investigate a
possible connection between C and the presence of planetary companions.
<BR /> Methods: We used the HARPS spectrograph to obtain high-resolution
optical spectra of our targets. Spectral synthesis of the CH band at
4300 {\AA} was performed with the spectral synthesis codes MOOG and
FITTING. <BR /> Results: We have studied carbon in several reliable
spectral windows and have obtained abundances and distributions that
show that planet host stars are carbon rich when compared to single
stars, a signature caused by the known metal-rich nature of stars with
planets. We find no different behaviour when separating the stars by the
mass of the planetary companion <BR /> Conclusions: We conclude that
reliable carbon abundances can be derived for solar-type stars from the
CH band at 4300 {\AA}. We confirm two different slope trends for
[C/Fe] with [Fe/H] because the behaviour is opposite for stars above and
below solar values. We observe a flat distribution of the [C/Fe] ratio
for all planetary masses, a finding that apparently excludes any clear
connection between the [C/Fe] abundance ratio and planetary mass.

S/N\~{}=300-500) echelle spectra of over 1000 nearby stars taken with the
Hamilton spectrograph at Lick Observatory, the HIRES spectrograph at
Keck, and UCLES at the Anglo Australian Observatory. A uniform analysis
of the high-resolution spectra has yielded precise stellar parameters
(T$_{eff}$, logg, vsini, [M/H], and individual elemental
abundances for Fe, Ni, Si, Na, and Ti), enabling systematic error
analyses and accurate theoretical stellar modeling. We have created a
large database of theoretical stellar evolution tracks using the Yale
Stellar Evolution Code (YREC) to match the observed parameters of the
SPOCS stars. Our very dense grids of evolutionary tracks eliminate the
need for interpolation between stellar evolutionary tracks and allow
precise determinations of physical stellar parameters (mass, age,
radius, size and mass of the convective zone, surface gravity, etc.).
Combining our stellar models with the observed stellar atmospheric
parameters and uncertainties, we compute the likelihood for each set of
stellar model parameters separated by uniform time steps along the
stellar evolutionary tracks. The computed likelihoods are used for a
Bayesian analysis to derive posterior probability distribution functions
for the physical stellar parameters of interest. We provide a catalog of
physical parameters for 1074 stars that are based on a uniform set of
high-quality spectral observations, a uniform spectral reduction
procedure, and a uniform set of stellar evolutionary models. We explore
this catalog for various possible correlations between stellar and
planetary properties, which may help constrain the formation and
dynamical histories of other planetary systems.

new models of massive stars, from 14 to 350 M$_{&sun;}$. The input
physics is the same used in the PARSEC V1.1 version, but for the
mass-loss rate from considering the most recent updates in the
literature. We focus on low metallicity, Z = 0.001 and Z = 0.004, for
which the metal-poor dwarf irregular star-forming galaxies, Sextans A,
the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte galaxy and NGC 6822, provide simple but
powerful workbenches. The models reproduce fairly well the observed
colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) but the stellar colour distributions
indicate that the predicted blue loop is not hot enough in models with a
canonical extent of overshooting. In the framework of a mild extended
mixing during central hydrogen burning, the only way to reconcile the
discrepancy is to enhance the overshooting at the base of the convective
envelope (EO) during the first dredge-up. The mixing scales required to
reproduce the observed loops, EO = 2H$_{P}$ or EO =
4H$_{P}$, are definitely larger than those derived from, e.g. the
observed location of the red-giant-branch bump in low mass stars. This
effect, if confirmed, would imply a strong dependence of the mixing
scale below the formal Schwarzschild border, on the stellar mass or
luminosity. Reproducing the features of the observed CMDs with standard
values of envelope overshooting would require a metallicity
significantly lower than the values measured in these galaxies. Other
quantities, such as the star formation rate and the initial mass
function, are only slightly sensitive to this effect. Future
investigations will consider other metallicities and different mixing
schemes.

to first investigate whether their analysis can be performed using the

eased extraction of simply connected spatial volumes, without needing to

of galaxies using modest computing resources, even when using EAGLE
simulations with large numbers of particles. A reading routine is
provided to simplify this process.

However, robust constraints on stellar ages are currently available for
only a limited number of stars. The all-sky survey TESS (Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite) will observe the brightest stars in the sky
and thus can be used to investigate the age distributions of stars in
these components of the Galaxy via asteroseismology, where previously
this has been difficult using other techniques. The aim of this
preliminary study was to determine whether TESS will be able to provide
evidence for quenching periods during the star formation history of the
Milky Way. Using a population synthesis code, we produced populations
based on various stellar formation history models and limited the
analysis to red-giant-branch stars. We investigated the
mass-Galactic-disk-height distributions, where stellar mass was used as
an age proxy, to test for whether periods of quenching can be observed
by TESS. We found that even with the addition of 15\% noise to the
inferred masses, it will be possible for TESS to find evidence
for/against quenching periods suggested in the literature (e.g. between
7 and 9 Gyr ago), therefore providing stringent constraints on the
formation and evolution of the Milky Way.

  Abstract                 = {{The typical methodology for comparing simulated galaxies with
observational surveys is usually to apply a spatial selection to the
simulation to mimic the region of interest covered by a comparable
observational survey sample. In this work we compare this approach with
a more sophisticated post-processing in which the observational
uncertainties and selection effects (photometric, surface gravity and
effective temperature) are taken into account. We compare a `solar
neighbourhood analogue' region in a model Milky Way-like galaxy
simulated with RAMSES-CH with fourth release Gaia-ESO survey data. We
find that a simple spatial cut alone is insufficient and that
observational uncertainties must be accounted for in the comparison.
This is particularly true when the scale of uncertainty is large
compared to the dynamic range of the data, e.g. in our comparison, the
[Mg/Fe] distribution is affected much more than the more accurately
determined [Fe/H] distribution. Despite clear differences in the
underlying distributions of elemental abundances between simulation and
observation, incorporating scatter to our simulation results to mimic
observational uncertainty produces reasonable agreement. The quite
complete nature of the Gaia-ESO survey means that the selection function
has minimal impact on the distribution of observed age and metal
abundances but this would become increasingly more important for surveys
with narrower selection functions.

perturbation of the merging dwarf galaxies, cannot be ruled out. The

  Abstract                 = {{It is now well-established that the elemental abundance patterns of
stars hold key clues not only to their formation, but also to the
assembly histories of galaxies. One of the most exciting possibilities
is the use of stellar abundance patterns as {\ldquo}chemical tags{\rdquo}
to identify stars that were born in the same molecular cloud. In this
paper, we assess the prospects of chemical tagging as a function of
several key underlying parameters. We show that in the fiducial case of
10$^{4}$ distinct cells in chemical space and
$\{$10$\}$$^{5}$-$\{$10$\}$$^{6}$ stars in the survey, one can expect to
detect {\sim} $\{$10$\}$$^{2}$-$\{$10$\}$$^{3}$ groups that are {\ge}slant
5{$\sigma$} overdensities in the chemical space. However, we find that
even very large overdensities in chemical space do not guarantee that
the overdensity is due to a single set of stars from a common birth
cloud. In fact, for our fiducial model parameters, the typical 5{$\sigma$} 
overdensity is comprised of stars from a wide range of clusters with the
most dominant cluster contributing only 25\% of the stars. The most
important factors limiting the identification of disrupted clusters via
chemical tagging are the number of chemical cells in the chemical space
and the survey sampling rate of the underlying stellar population. Both
of these factors can be improved through strategic observational plans.
While recovering individual clusters through chemical tagging may prove
challenging, we show, in agreement with previous work, that different
CMFs imprint different degrees of clumpiness in chemical space. These
differences provide the opportunity to statistically reconstruct the
slope and high-mass cutoff of CMF and its evolution through cosmic time.

abundances for many individual elements. With uncertainties of $\{${$\sigma$}

for 10 elements measured for $\backslash$gt $\{$10$\}$$^{4}$ stars, the APOGEE DR12
spectra may be the first well-suited data set to put this idea into
practice. We find that even APOGEE data offer only {\tilde}500 independent
volume elements in the 10-dimensional abundance space, when we focus on
the {$\alpha$}-enhanced Galactic disk. We develop and apply a new algorithm
to search for chemically homogeneous sets of stars against a dominant
background. By injecting star clusters into the APOGEE data set, we show
that chemically homogeneous clusters with masses {\gsim} 3{\times}
$\{$10$\}$$^{7}$ $\{$M$\}$$_{&sun; }$ would be easily detectable and
yet no such signal is seen in the data. By generalizing this approach,
we put a first abundance-based constraint on the cluster mass function
for the old disk stars in the Milky Way.

  Abstract                 = {{Oxygen is the most abundant ``metal'' element in stars and in the cosmos.
But determining oxygen abundances in stars has proven challenging,
because of the shortage of detectable atomic oxygen lines in their
optical spectra as well as observational and theoretical complications
with these lines (e.g., blends, 3D, non-LTE). Nonetheless, Ting et al.
(2017) were recently able to demonstrate that oxygen abundances can be
determined from low-resolution (R$\simeq$2000) optical spectra. Here we
investigate the physical processes that enable such a measurement for
cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that the strongest spectral
diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO atomic-molecular network, but
are manifested in spectral features that do not involve oxygen. In the
outer atmosphere layers most of the carbon is locked up in CO, and
changes to the oxygen abundance directly affect the abundances of all
other carbon-bearing molecules, thereby changing the strength of CH, CN,
and C$\_2$ features across the optical spectrum. In deeper atmosphere
layers most of the carbon is in atomic form, and any change in the
oxygen abundance has little effect on the other carbon-bearing
molecules. The key physical effect enabling such oxygen abundance
measurements is that spectral features in the optical arise from both
the CO-dominant and the atomic carbon-dominant regions, providing
non-degenerate constraints on both C and O. Beyond the case at hand, the
results show that physically sound abundances measurements need not be
limited to those elements that have observable lines themselves.

Spectrograph (HERMES) chemical tagging survey of about a million
Galactic FGK stars, we estimate the number of independent dimensions of
the space defined by the stellar chemical element abundances [X/Fe].
This leads to a way to study the origin of elements from observed
chemical abundances using principal component analysis. We explore
abundances in several environments, including solar neighbourhood
thin/thick disc stars, halo metal-poor stars, globular clusters, open
clusters, the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Fornax dwarf spheroidal
galaxy. By studying solar-neighbourhood stars, we confirm the
universality of the r-process that tends to produce [neutron-capture
elements/Fe] in a constant ratio. We find that, especially at low
metallicity, the production of r-process elements is likely to be
associated with the production of {$\alpha$}-elements. This may support the
core-collapse supernovae as the r-process site. We also verify the
overabundances of light s-process elements at low metallicity, and find
that the relative contribution decreases at higher metallicity, which
suggests that this lighter elements primary process may be associated
with massive stars. We also verify the contribution from the s-process
in low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars at high metallicity. Our
analysis reveals two types of core-collapse supernovae: one produces
mainly {$\alpha$}-elements, the other produces both {$\alpha$}-elements and
Fe-peak elements with a large enhancement of heavy Fe-peak elements
which may be the contribution from hypernovae. Excluding light elements
that may be subject to internal mixing, K and Cu, we find that the
[X/Fe] chemical abundance space in the solar neighbourhood has about six
independent dimensions both at low metallicity (-3.5 {\lsim} [Fe/H]
{\lsim}-2) and high metallicity ([Fe/H] {\gsim}-1). However the dimensions
come from very different origins in these two cases. The extra
contribution from low-mass AGB stars at high metallicity compensates the
dimension loss due to the homogenization of the core-collapse supernovae
ejecta. Including the extra dimensions from [Fe/H], K, Cu and the light
elements, the number of independent dimensions of the [X/Fe]+[Fe/H]
chemical space in the solar neighbourhood for HERMES is about eight to
nine. Comparing fainter galaxies and the solar neighbourhood, we find
that the chemical space for fainter galaxies such as Fornax and the
Large Magellanic Cloud has a higher dimensionality. This is consistent
with the slower star formation history of fainter galaxies. We find that
open clusters have more chemical space dimensions than the nearby
metal-rich field stars. This suggests that a survey of stars in a larger
Galactic volume than the solar neighbourhood may show about one more
dimension in its chemical abundance space.

million stars across the Milky Way, far more than any current stellar
survey at a corresponding or higher spectral resolution. It is often
assumed that only very few elemental abundances can be measured from
such low-resolution spectra, limiting their utility for Galactic
archaeology studies. However, Ting et al. used ab initio models to argue
that low-resolution spectra should enable precision measurements of many
elemental abundances, at least in theory. Here, we verify this claim in
practice by measuring the relative abundances of 14 elements from LAMOST
spectra with a precision of {\lsim} 0.1 dex for objects with
$\{$$\{$S$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$$\{$N$\}$$\}$$\}$$_{{LAMOST}$$\}${\gsim} 30 (per pixel). We employ a
spectral modeling method in which a data-driven model is combined with
priors that the model gradient spectra should resemble ab initio
spectral models. This approach assures that the data-driven abundance
determinations draw on physically sensible features in the spectrum in
their predictions and do not just exploit astrophysical correlations
among abundances. Our analysis is constrained to the number of elemental
abundances measured in the APOGEE survey, which is the source of the
training labels. Obtaining high quality/resolution spectra for a subset
of LAMOST stars to measure more elemental abundances as training labels
and then applying this method to the full LAMOST catalog will provide a
sample with more than 20 elemental abundances, which is an order of
magnitude larger than current high-resolution surveys, substantially
increasing the sample size for Galactic archaeology.

stellar haloes of six simulated Milky-Way-like galaxies from the
Aquarius Project. Binding energy criteria are adopted to define two
dynamically distinct stellar populations: the diffuse inner and outer
haloes, which comprise different stellar subpopulations with particular
chemical and kinematic characteristics. Our simulated inner- and
outer-halo stellar populations have received contributions from debris
stars (formed in subgalactic systems while they were outside the virial
radius of the main progenitor galaxies) and endo-debris stars (those
formed in gas-rich subgalactic systems inside the dark matter haloes of
the main progenitor galaxy). The inner haloes possess an additional
contribution from disc-heated stars, in the range {\tilde}3-30 per cent,
with a mean of {\tilde}20 per cent. Disc-heated stars might exhibit
signatures of kinematical support, in particular among the youngest
ones. Endo-debris plus disc-heated stars define the so-called in situ
stellar populations. In both the inner- and outer-halo stellar
populations, we detect contributions from stars with moderate to low
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios, mainly associated with the endo-debris or
disc-heated subpopulations. The observed abundance gradients in the
inner-halo regions are influenced by both the level of chemical
enrichment and the relative contributions from each stellar
subpopulation. Steeper abundance gradients in the inner-halo regions are
related to contributions from the disc-heated and endo-debris stars,
which tend to be found at lower binding energies than debris stars. In
the case of the outer-halo regions, although [Fe/H] gradients are
relatively mild, the steeper profiles arise primarily due to
contributions from stars formed in more massive satellites, which sink
farther into the main halo system, and tend to have higher levels of
chemical enrichment and lower energies. Our findings support the
existence of (at least) two distinct diffuse stellar halo populations,
as suggested by a number of recent observations in the Milky Way and
M31. Our results also indicate that a comparison of the range of
predicted kinematics, abundance gradients and frequency of
[{$\alpha$}/Fe]-deficient stars with observations of these quantities in
the Milky Way, M31 and other large spirals can both provide clues to
improve the modelling of baryonic physics, and reveal detailed
information about their likely history of formation and evolution.

It is targeting a randomly selected magnitude-limited (V ≤ 14) sample of stars, with the goal of observing one million objects. To date, 300,000 spectra have been obtained. Not all of them are correctly processed by parameter estimation pipelines, and we need to know about them. We present a semi-automated classification scheme that identifies different types of peculiar spectral morphologies in an effort to discover and flag potentially problematic spectra and thus help to preserve the integrity of the survey results. To this end, we employ the recently developed dimensionality reduction technique t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding), which enables us to represent the complex spectral morphology in a two-dimensional projection map while still preserving the properties of the local neighborhoods of spectra. We find that the majority (178,483) of the 209,533 Galah spectra considered in this study represents normal single stars, whereas 31,050 peculiar and problematic spectra with very diverse spectral features pertaining to 28,579 stars are distributed into 10 classification categories: hot stars, cool metal-poor giants, molecular absorption bands, binary stars, Hα/Hβ emission, Hα/Hβ emission superimposed on absorption, Hα/Hβ P-Cygni, Hα/Hβ inverted P-Cygni, lithium absorption, and problematic. Classified spectra with supplementary information are presented in the catalog, indicating candidates for follow-up observations and population studies of the short-lived phases of stellar evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {{Context. A sample of mostly old metal-rich dwarf and turn-off stars with
high eccentricity and low maximum height above the Galactic plane has
been identified. From their kinematics, it was suggested that the inner
disk is their most probable birthplace. Their chemical imprints may
therefore reveal important information about the formation and evolution
of the still poorly understood inner disk. <BR /> Aims: To probe the
formation history of these stellar populations, a detailed analysis of a
sample of very metal-rich stars is carried out. We derive the
metallicities, abundances of {$\alpha$} elements, ages, and Galactic
orbits. <BR /> Methods: The analysis of 71 metal-rich stars is based on
optical high-resolution {\'e}chelle spectra obtained with the FEROS
spectrograph at the ESO 1.52-m Telescope at La Silla, Chile. The
metallicities and abundances of C, O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti were derived
based on LTE detailed analysis, employing the MARCS model atmospheres.
<BR /> Results: We confirm the high metallicity of these stars reaching
up to [Fe i/H] = 0.58, and the sample of metal-rich dwarfs can be
kinematically subclassified in samples of thick disk, thin disk, and
intermediate stellar populations. All sample stars show solar {$\alpha$}-Fe
ratios, and most of them are old and still quite metal rich. The orbits
suggest that the thin disk, thick disk and intermediate populations were
formed at Galactocentric distances of \~{}8 kpc, \~{}6 kpc, and \~{}7 kpc,
respectively. The mean maximum height of the thick disk subsample of
Z$_{max}$ \~{} 380 pc, is lower than for typical thick disk stars. A
comparison of {$\alpha$}-element abundances of the sample stars with bulge
stars shows that the oxygen is compatible with a bulge or inner thick
disk origin. Our results suggest that models of radial mixing and
dynamical effects of the bar and bar/spiral arms might explain the
presence of these old metal-rich dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood.

that aims to recover the Milky Way's (MW) gravitational potential from
large samples of stars in the Galactic disk. RoadMapping models the
observed positions and velocities of stars with a parametrized,
three-integral distribution function (DF) in a parametrized axisymmetric
potential. We investigate through differential test cases with idealized
mock data how the breakdown of model assumptions and data properties
affect constraints on the potential and DF. Our key results are: (i) If
the MW's true potential is not included in the assumed model potential
family, we can - in the axisymmetric case - still find a robust estimate
for the potential, with only $\lt$\~{} 10\% difference in surface density
within |z| $\lt$= 1.1 kpc inside the observed volume. (ii) Modest
systematic differences between the true and model DF are
inconsequential. E.g, when binning stars to define sub-populations with
simple DFs, binning errors do not affect the modelling as long as the DF
parameters of neighbouring bins differ by $\lt$ 20\%. In addition,
RoadMapping ensures unbiased potential estimates for either (iii) small
misjudgements of the spatial selection function (i.e., $\lt$\~{} 15\% at the
survey volume's edge), (iv) if distances are known to within 10\%, or (v)
if proper motion uncertainties are known within 10\% or are smaller than
delta mu $\lt$\~{} 1 mas/yr. Challenges are the rapidly increasing
computational costs for large sample sizes. Overall, RoadMapping is well
suited to making precise new measurements of the MW's potential with
data from the upcoming Gaia releases.

orbit a variety of host stars in diverse Galactic environments. Of

an extremely truncated brown dwarf (BD) desert with a paucity of BD
companions only for systems with a$\backslash$quad $\backslash$lt 0.1-0.2 AU, with no

been identified around metal-poor ([Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.5) stars in this

  Abstract                 = {{In the era of vast spectroscopic surveys focusing on Galactic stellar
populations, astronomers want to exploit the large quantity and good
quality of data to derive their atmospheric parameters without losing
precision from automatic procedures. In this work, we developed a new
spectral package, FASMA, to estimate the stellar atmospheric parameters
(namely effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity) in a
fast and robust way. This method is suitable for spectra of FGK-type
stars in medium and high resolution. The spectroscopic analysis is based
on the spectral synthesis technique using the radiative transfer code,
MOOG. The line list is comprised of mainly iron lines in the optical
spectrum. The atomic data are calibrated after the Sun and Arcturus. We
use two comparison samples to test our method, (i) a sample of 451
FGK-type dwarfs from the high-resolution HARPS spectrograph; and (ii)
the Gaia-ESO benchmark stars using both high and medium resolution
spectra. We explore biases in our method from the analysis of synthetic
spectra covering the parameter space of our interest. We show that our
spectral package is able to provide reliable results for a wide range of
stellar parameters, different rotational velocities, different
instrumental resolutions and for different spectral regions of the
VLT-GIRAFFE spectrographs, used amongst others for the Gaia-ESO survey.
FASMA estimates stellar parameters in less than 15 m for high-resolution
and 3 m for medium-resolution spectra. The complete package is publicly
available to the community.

stellar atmospheric parameters necessary to characterize a star. There
are several methods to derive these parameters and a comparison of their
results often shows considerable discrepancies, even in the restricted
group of solar-type FGK dwarfs. <BR /> Aims: We want to check the
differences in temperature between the standard spectroscopic technique
based on iron lines and the infrared flux method (IRFM). We aim to
improve the description of the spectroscopic temperatures especially for
the cooler stars where the differences between the two methods are
higher, as presented in a previous work. <BR /> Methods: Our
spectroscopic analysis was based on the iron excitation and ionization
balance, assuming Kurucz model atmospheres in LTE. The abundance
analysis was determined using the code MOOG. We optimized the line list
using a cool star (HD 21749) with high resolution and high
signal-to-noise spectrum, as a reference in order to check for weak,
isolated lines. <BR /> Results: We test the quality of the new line list
by re-deriving stellar parameters for 451 stars with high resolution and
signal-to-noise HARPS spectra, that were analyzed in a previous work
with a larger line list. The comparison in temperatures between this
work and the latest IRFM for the stars in common shows that the
differences for the cooler stars are significantly smaller and more
homogeneously distributed than in previous studies for stars with
temperatures below 5000 K. Moreover, a comparison is presented between
interferometric temperatures with our results that shows good agreement,
even though the sample is small and the errors of the mean differences
are large. We use the new line list to re-derive parameters for some of
the cooler stars that host planets. Finally, we present the impact of
the new temperatures on the [Cr i/Cr ii] and [Ti i/Ti ii] abundance
ratios that previously showed systematic trends with temperature. We
show that the slopes of these trends for the cooler stars become
drastically smaller.

  Abstract                 = {{Meteoritic abundances of r-process elements are analyzed to deduce the
history of chemical enrichment by r-process from the beginning of disk
formation to the present time in the solar vicinity, by combining the
abundance information from short-lived radioactive nuclei such as 244Pu
with that from stable r-process nuclei such as Eu. These two types of
nuclei can be associated with one r-process event and cumulation of
events till formation of the solar system, respectively. With help of
the observed local star formation history, we deduce the chemical
evolution of 244Pu and obtain three main results: (i) the last r-process
event occurred 130-140 Myr before formation of the solar system, (ii)
the present-day low 244Pu abundance as measured in deep sea reservoirs
results from the low recent star formation rate compared to \~{}4.5 - 5 Gyr
ago, and (iii) there were \~{}15 r-process events in the solar vicinity
from formation of the Galaxy to the time of solar system formation and
\~{}30 r-process events to the present time. Then, adopting a reasonable
hypothesis that a neutron star merger is the r-process production site,
we find that the ejected r-process elements are extensively spread out
and mixed with interstellar matter with a mass of \~{}3.5 million solar
masses, which is about 100 times larger than that for supernova ejecta.
In addition, the event frequency of r-process production is estimated to
be one per about 1400 core-collapse supernovae, which is identical to
the frequency of neutron star mergers estimated from the analysis of
stellar abundances.

line-by-line differential method within a 1D LTE framework. Stellar
parameters and iron abundances were measured in Paper I of this series
for all stars, but a few (three) required a small revision. <BR />
Results: The [Y/Mg] ratio shows a strong correlation with age. It has a
slope of -0.041 {\plusmn} 0.001 dex/Gyr and a significance of 41{$\sigma$}.
This is in excellent agreement with the relation first proposed by
Nissen (2015). We found some outliers that turned out to be binaries
where mass transfer may have enhanced the yttrium abundance. Given a
precise measurement of [Y/Mg] with typical error of 0.02 dex in solar
twins, our formula can be used to determine a stellar age with \~{}0.8 Gyr
precision in the 0 to 10 Gyr range.

  Abstract                 = {{This paper presents theoretical star formation and chemical enrichment
histories for the stellar halo of the Milky Way (MW) based on new
chemodynamical modeling. The goal of this study is to assess the extent
to which metal-poor stars in the halo reflect the star formation
conditions that occurred in halo progenitor galaxies at high redshift,
before, and during the epoch of re-ionization. Simple prescriptions that
translate dark-matter (DM) halo mass into baryonic gas budgets and star
formation histories yield models that resemble the observed MW halo in
its total stellar mass, metallicity distribution, and the luminosity
function and chemical enrichment of dwarf satellite galaxies. These
model halos in turn allow an exploration of how the populations of
interest for probing the epoch of re-ionization are distributed in
physical and phase space, and of how they are related to lower-redshift
populations of the same metallicity. The fraction of stars dating from
before a particular time or redshift depends strongly on radius within
the galaxy, reflecting the ''inside-out'' growth of cold DM halos, and on
metallicity, reflecting the general trend toward higher metallicity at
later times. These results suggest that efforts to discover stars from
z$\gt$6-10 should select for stars with [Fe/H] lsim-3 and favor stars on
more tightly bound orbits in the stellar halo, where the majority are
from z$\gt$10 and 15\%-40\% are from z$\gt$15. The oldest, most metal-poor
stars{\mdash}those most likely to reveal the chemical abundances of the
first stars{\mdash}are most common in the very center of the Galaxy's
halo: they are in the bulge, but not of the bulge. These models have
several implications for the larger project of constraining the
properties of the first stars and galaxies using data from the local
universe.

and/or moderate dispersion spectroscopy has been transformed to a common
metallicity scale and used to study the local structure and evolution of
the galactic disk. The metallicity distribution of clusters with
galactocentric distance is best described by two distinct zones. Between
R$_{GC}$=6.5 and 10 kpc, the metallicity distribution has a mean
[Fe/H]=0.0 and a dispersion of 0.1 dex; there is, at best, weak evidence
for a shallow abundance gradient over this distance range. Beyond = 10
kpc, the metallicity distribution has a dispersion between 0.10 and 0.15
dex, but with a mean [Fe/H] -0.3, implying a sharp discontinuity at
R$_{GC}$ = 10 kpc. After correcting for the discontinuity, no
evidence is found for a gradient perpendicular to the plane. Adopting
the clusters interior to 10 kpc as a representative sample of the
galactic disk over the last 7 Gyr, the cluster metallicity range is
found to be approximately half that of the field star distribution. When
coupled with the discontinuity in the galactocentric gradient, the
discrepancy in the metallicity distribution is interpreted as an
indication of significant diffusion of field stars into the solar
neighborhood from beyond 10 kpc. These results imply that, contrary to
earlier claims, the sun is not atypical of the stars formed in the solar
circle 4.6 Gyr ago. It is suggested that the discontinuity is a
reflection of the edge of the initial galactic disk as defined by the
disk globular cluster system and the so-called thick disk; the initial
offset in [Fe/H] created by the differences in the chemical history on
either side of the discontinuity has been carried through to the current
stage of galactic evolution. If correct, diffusion coupled with the
absence of an abundance gradient could make the separation of field
stars on the basis of galactocentric origin difficult, if not
impossible.

clusters toward the bulge can be used to trace its dynamical and
chemical evolution. In the bulge direction, there are \~{}50 clusters, but
only about 20\% have been subject of high-resolution spectroscopic
investigations. So far, the sample observed at high resolution spans a
moderate-to-high metallicity regime. In this sample, however, very few
are located in the innermost region (R$_{GC}$ {\le} 1.5 Kpc and |
l,b | {\le} 5{\deg}). To constrain the chemical evolution enrichment of
the innermost region of Galaxy, accurate abundances and abundance
patterns of key elements based on high-resolution spectroscopy are
necessary. Here we present the results we obtained for Terzan 1, a
metal-poor cluster located in the innermost bulge region. <BR />
Methods: Using the near-infrared spectrograph CRIRES at ESO/VLT, we
obtained high-resolution (R {\ap} 50 000) H-band spectra of 16 bright
giant stars in the innermost region (r {\le} 60'') of Terzan 1. Full
spectral synthesis techniques and equivalent width measurements of
selected lines, isolated and free of significant blending and/or
contamination by telluric lines, allowed accurate chemical abundances
and radial velocities to be derived. <BR /> Results: Fifteen out of 16
observed stars are likely cluster members, with an average heliocentric
radial velocity of +57 {\plusmn} 1.8 km s$^{-1}$ and mean iron
abundance of [ Fe/H ] = -1.26 {\plusmn} 0.03 dex. For these stars we
measured some [{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundance ratios, finding average values of [
O/Fe ] = +0.39 {\plusmn} 0.02 dex, [ Mg/Fe ] = +0.42 {\plusmn} 0.02 dex, [
Si/Fe ] = +0.31 {\plusmn} 0.04 dex, and [ Ti/Fe ] = +0.15 {\plusmn} 0.04
dex <BR /> Conclusions: The {$\alpha$} enhancement ({\ap}+0.4 dex) found in
the observed giant stars of Terzan 1 is consistent with previous
measurements on other, more metal-rich bulge clusters, which suggests a
rapid chemical enrichment.

  Abstract                 = {We present a set of 87 RAVE stars with detected solar like oscillations, observed during Campaign 1 of the K2 mission (RAVE K2-C1 sample). This data set provides a useful benchmark for testing the gravities provided in RAVE data release 4 (DR4), and is key for the calibration of the RAVE data release 5 (DR5). The RAVE survey collected medium-resolution spectra (R = 7500) centred in the Ca II triplet(8600 Å) wavelength interval, which although being very useful for determining radial velocity and metallicity, even at low S/N, is known be affected by a log (g)-Teff degeneracy. This degeneracy is the cause of the large spread in the RAVE DR4 gravities for giants. The understanding of the trends and offsets that affects RAVE atmospheric parameters, and in particular log (g), is a crucial step in obtaining not only improved abundance measurements, but also improved distances and ages. In the present work, we use two different pipelines, GAUFRE and Sp_Ace, to determine atmospheric parameters and abundances by fixing log (g) to the seismic one. Our strategy ensures highly consistent values among all stellar parameters, leading to more accurate chemical abundances. A comparison of the chemical abundances obtained here with and without the use of seismic log (g) information has shown that an underestimated (overestimated) gravity leads to an underestimated (overestimated) elemental abundance (e.g. [Mg/H] is underestimated by 0.25 dex when the gravity is underestimated by 0.5 dex). We then perform a comparison between the seismic gravities and the spectroscopic gravities presented in the RAVE DR4 catalogue, extracting a calibration for log (g) of RAVE giants in the colour interval 0.50 < (J-KS) < 0.85. Finally, we show a comparison of the distances, temperatures, extinctions (and ages) derived here for our RAVE K2-C1 sample with those derived in RAVE DR4 and DR5. DR5 performs better than DR4 thanks to the seismic calibration, although discrepancies can still be important for objects for which the difference between DR4/DR5 and seismic gravities differ by more than 0.5 dex. The method illustrated in this work will be used for analysing RAVE targets present in the other K2 campaigns, in the framework of Galactic Archaeology investigations.

provide unique stellar databases for better investigating the formation

accuracy of the basic stellar properties derived: large uncertainties in
stellar parameters lead to large uncertainties in abundances, distances
and ages. Asteroseismology has a key role in this context: when seismic
information is combined with information derived from spectroscopic
analysis, highly precise constraints on distances, masses, extinction
and ages of red giants can be obtained. In the light of this promising
joint action, we started the CoRoT-GES collaboration. We present a set
of 1111 CoRoT stars, observed by GES from December 2011 to July 2014,

Galactic disk. Among these stars, 534 have reliable global seismic
parameters. By combining seismic informations and spectroscopy, we
derived precise stellar parameters, ages, kinematic and orbital
parameters and detailed element abundances for this sample of stars. We
also show that, thanks to asteroseismology, we are able to obtain a
higher precision than what can be achieved by the standard spectroscopic
means. This sample of CoRoT red giants, spanning Galactocentric
distances from 5 to 8 kpc and a wide age interval (1-13 Gyr), provides
us a representative sample for the inner disk population.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Stellar age determination by means of grid-based techniques
that adopt asteroseismic constraints is a well established method
nowadays. However some theoretical aspects of the systematic and
statistical errors affecting these age estimates still have to be
investigated. <BR /> Aims: We study the impact on stellar age
determination of the uncertainty in the radiative opacity, in the
initial helium abundance, in the mixing-length value, in the convective
core overshooting, and in the microscopic diffusion efficiency adopted
in stellar model computations. <BR /> Methods: We extended our SCEPtER
grid to include stars with mass in the range [0.8; 1.6]
M$_{&sun;}$ and evolutionary stages from the zero-age main
sequence to the central hydrogen depletion. For the age estimation we
adopted the same maximum likelihood technique as described in our
previous work. To quantify the systematic errors arising from the
current uncertainty in model computations, many synthetic grids of
stellar models with perturbed input were adopted. <BR /> Results: We
found that the current typical uncertainty in the observations accounts
for 1{$\sigma$} statistical relative error in age determination, which on
average ranges from about -35\% to +42\%, depending on the mass. However,
owing to the strong dependence on the evolutionary phase, the age's
relative error can be higher than 120\% for stars near the zero-age main
sequence, while it is typically of the order of 20\% or lower in the
advanced main-sequence phase. The systematic bias on age determination
due to a variation of {\plusmn}1 in the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio
{$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z is about one-fourth of the statistical error in the
first 30\% of the evolution, while it is negligible for more evolved
stages. The maximum bias due to the presence of the convective core
overshooting is -7\% and -13\% for mild and strong overshooting scenarios.
For all the examined models, the impact of a variation of {\plusmn}5\% in
the radiative opacity was found to be negligible. The most important
source of bias is the uncertainty in the mixing-length value
{$\alpha$}$_{ml}$ and the neglect of microscopic diffusion. Each of
these effects accounts for a bias that is nearly equal to the random
error uncertainty. Comparison of the results of our technique with other
grid techniques on a set of common stars showed general agreement.
However, the adoption of a different grid can account for a variation in
the mean estimated age up to 1 Gyr.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. Recent results by Bensby and collaborators on the ages of
microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars in the Galactic bulge have
challenged the picture of an exclusively old stellar population, because
ages significantly younger than 9 Gyr have been found. <BR /> Aims:
However, these age estimates have not been independently confirmed with
different techniques and theoretical stellar models. One of the aims of
this paper is to verify these results by means of a grid-based method.
We also quantify the systematic biases that might be induced by some
assumptions adopted to compute stellar models. In particular, we explore
the impact of increasing the initial helium abundance, neglecting the
element microscopic diffusion, and changing the mixing-length
calibration in theoretical stellar track computations. <BR /> Methods:
We adopt the SCEPtER pipeline with a newly computed stellar model grid
for metallicities [Fe/H] from - 2.00 dex to 0.55 dex, and masses in the
range [0.60; 1.60] M$_{&sun;}$ from the zero-age main sequence to
the helium flash at the red giant branch tip. By means of Monte Carlo
simulations we show for the considered evolutionary phases that our
technique provides unbiased age estimates. <BR /> Results: Our age
results are in good agreement with Bensby and collaborators findings and
show 16 stars younger than 5 Gyr and 28 younger than 9 Gyr over a sample
of 58. The effect of a helium enhancement as large as {$\Delta$}Y/ {$\Delta$}Z
= 5 is quite modest, resulting in a mean age increase of metal rich
stars of 0.6 Gyr. Even simultaneously adopting a high helium content and
the upper values of age estimates, there is evidence of 4 stars younger
than 5 Gyr and 15 younger than 9 Gyr. For stars younger than 5 Gyr, the
use of stellar models computed by neglecting microscopic diffusion or by
assuming a super-solar mixing-length value leads to a mean increase in
the age estimates of about 0.4 Gyr and 0.5 Gyr respectively. Even
considering the upper values for the age estimates, there are four stars
estimated younger than 5 Gyr is in both cases. Thus, the assessment of a
sizeable fraction of young stars among the microlensed sample in the
Galactic bulge appears robust.

the age of stars in detached eclipsing binary systems. We evaluate the
precision of the estimates due to the uncertainty in the observational
constraints, and the systematic bias caused by the uncertainty in
convective core overshooting, element diffusion, mixing-length value,
and initial helium content. We adopted the SCEPtER grid, which includes
stars with mass in the range [0.8; 1.6] Msun and evolutionary stages
from the ZAMS to the central hydrogen depletion. Age estimates have been
obtained by a generalisation of the technique described in our previous
work. We showed that the typical 1 sigma random error in age estimates -
due to the uncertainty on the observational constraints - is about +-
7\%, which is nearly independent of the masses of the two stars. However,
such an error strongly depends on the evolutionary phase and becomes
larger and asymmetric for stars near the ZAMS where it ranges from about
+90\% to -25\%. The systematic bias due to the including mild and strong
convective core overshooting is about 50\% and 120\% of the error due to
observational uncertainties. A variation of +- 1 in the helium-to-metal
enrichment ratio accounts for about +- 150\% of the random error. The
neglect of microscopic diffusion accounts for a bias of about 60\% of the
random error. We also introduced a statistical test of the expected
difference in the recovered age of two coeval stars in a binary system.
We find that random fluctuations within the current observational
uncertainties can lead genuine coeval binary components to appear to be
non-coeval with a difference in age as high as 60\%.

study the impact on mass and radius determination of the uncertainty in

in the range [0.8-1.1] M$_{&sun;}$ and evolutionary stages from
the zero-age main sequence to the central hydrogen exhaustion. To
recover the stellar parameters, a maximum-likelihood technique was
employed by comparing the observations constraints to a precomputed grid

components, owing to the current typical uncertainty in the
observations, are nearly constant in all cases at about 4.5\% and 2.2\% on

and radius determination due to a variation of {\plusmn} 1 in
{$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z is {\plusmn}2.3\% and {\plusmn} 1.1\%; the one due to a
change of {\plusmn} 0.24 in the value of the mixing-length
{$\alpha$}$_{ml}$ is {\plusmn} 2.1\% and {\plusmn} 1.0\%; the one due to
a variation of {\plusmn} 5\% in the radiative opacity is {\mnplus} 1.0\% and
{\mnplus} 0.45\%. An important bias source is to neglect microscopic
diffusion, which accounts for errors of about 3.7\% and 1.5\% on mass and
radius. The cumulative effects of the considered uncertainty sources can
produce biased estimates of stellar characteristics. Comparison of the
results of our technique with other grid techniques shows that the
systematic biases induced by the differences in the estimation grids are
generally greater than the statistical errors involved.

The new implementation uses vantage-point trees to compute sparse
pairwise similarities between the input data objects, and it uses a
variant of the Barnes-Hut algorithm - an algorithm used by astronomers
to perform N-body simulations - to approximate the forces between the
corresponding points in the embedding. Our experiments show that the new

advantages over standard t-SNE, and that it makes it possible to learn

the mass in the central 2 kpc of the galaxies increased by a factor of
3.2\^{}$\{$+0.8$\}$\_$\{$-0.7$\}$ between z = 2.5 and z = 1. We therefore rule out
simple models in which bulges were fully assembled at high redshift and
disks gradually formed around them. Instead, bulges (and black holes)
likely formed in lockstep with disks, through bar instabilities,
migration, or other processes. We find that after z = 1 the growth in
the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continued to be built

  Abstract                 = {{This paper presents a brief, semi-technical comparison of the essential
features of the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to statistical
inference, with several illustrative examples implemented in Python. The
differences between frequentism and Bayesianism fundamentally stem from
differing definitions of probability, a philosophical divide which leads
to distinct approaches to the solution of statistical problems as well
as contrasting ways of asking and answering questions about unknown
parameters. After an example-driven discussion of these differences, we
briefly compare several leading Python statistical packages which
implement frequentist inference using classical methods and Bayesian
inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo.

models, from low-amplitude, multi-armed galaxies to Milky Way-like

axisymmetrical potential. In the multi-armed galaxy the low-amplitude
arms represent tiny perturbations of the potential, hence the vertical
action for a set of stars is conserved, although after several orbital
periods of revolution the conservation degrades significantly. For a
Milky Way-like galaxy with vigorous spiral activity and the formation of
a bar, our results show that the potential is far from steady, implying
that the action is not a constant of motion. Furthermore, because of the
presence of high-amplitude arms and the bar, considerable in-plane and
vertical heating occurs that forces stars to deviate from near-circular
orbits, reducing the degree at which the actions are conserved for
individual stars, in agreement with previous results, but also for
ensembles of stars. If confirmed, this result has several implications,
including the assertion that the thick disk of our Galaxy forms by
radial migration of stars, under the assumption of the conservation of
the action describing the vertical motion of stars.

  Abstract                 = {{We study the radial migration of stars driven by recurring multi-arm
spiral features in an exponential disk embedded in a dark matter halo.
The spiral perturbations redistribute angular momentum within the disk
and lead to substantial radial displacements of individual stars, in a
manner that largely preserves the circularity of their orbits and that
results, after 5 Gyr (\~{}40 full rotations at the disk scale length), in
little radial heating and no appreciable changes to the vertical or
radial structure of the disk. Our results clarify a number of issues
related to the spatial distribution and kinematics of migrators. In
particular, we find that migrators are a heavily biased subset of stars
with preferentially low vertical velocity dispersions. This ``provenance
bias'' for migrators is not surprising in hindsight, for stars with small
vertical excursions spend more time near the disk plane, and thus
respond more readily to non-axisymmetric perturbations. We also find
that the vertical velocity dispersion of outward migrators always
decreases, whereas the opposite holds for inward migrators. To first
order, newly arrived migrators simply replace stars that have migrated
off to other radii, thus inheriting the vertical bias of the latter.
Extreme migrators might therefore be recognized, if present, by the
unexpectedly small amplitude of their vertical excursions. Our results
show that migration, understood as changes in angular momentum that
preserve circularity, can strongly affect the thin disk, but cast doubts
on models that envision the Galactic thick disk as a relic of radial
migration.

on the vertical structure of galaxy disks. The simulations follow three
exponential disks of different mass but similar circular velocity,
radial scalelength, and (constant) scale height. The disks develop
different non-axisymmetric patterns, ranging from feeble, long-lived
multiple arms to strong, rapidly evolving few-armed spirals. These
fluctuations induce radial migration through secular changes in the
angular momentum of disk particles, mixing the disk radially and
blurring pre-existing gradients. Migration primarily affects stars with
small vertical excursions, regardless of spiral pattern. This
{\ldquo}provenance bias{\rdquo} largely determines the vertical structure
of migrating stars: inward migrators thin down as they move in, whereas
outward migrators do not thicken up but rather preserve the disk scale
height at their destination. Migrators of equal birth radius thus
develop a strong scale-height gradient, not by flaring out as commonly
assumed, but by thinning down as they spread inward. Similar gradients
have been observed for low-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] mono-abundance populations
(MAPs) in the Galaxy, but our results argue against interpreting them as
a consequence of radial migration. This is because outward migration
does not lead to thickening, implying that the maximum scale height of
any population should reflect its value at birth. In contrast, Galactic
MAPs have scale heights that increase monotonically outward, reaching
values that greatly exceed those at their presumed birth radii. Given
the strong vertical bias affecting migration, a proper assessment of the
importance of radial migration in the Galaxy should take carefully into
account the strong radial dependence of the scale heights of the various
stellar populations.

substantially flat gradient for the nitrogen abundance, going up to 18
kpc of galactocentric distance, as well as a mild gradient, if any, for
oxygen. The data points for sulphur, although less numerous, give
abundances which are consistent with the behaviour observed for the

amount of precise photometric data. Among the stars observed, red giants
show a rich oscillation pattern that allows their precise
characterization. Long-duration observations allow for investigating the
fine structure of this oscillation pattern <BR /> Aims: A common pattern
of oscillation frequency was observed in red giant stars, which
corresponds to the second-order development of the asymptotic theory.
This pattern, called the universal red giant oscillation pattern,
describes the frequencies of stellar acoustic modes. We aim to
investigate the deviations observed from this universal pattern, thereby
characterizing them in terms of the location of the second ionization
zone of helium. We also show how this seismic signature depends on
stellar evolution. <BR /> Methods: We measured the frequencies of radial
modes with a maximum likelihood estimator method, then we identified a
modulation corresponding to the departure from the universal oscillation
pattern. <BR /> Results: We identify the modulation component of the
radial mode frequency spacings in more than five hundred red giants. The
variation in the modulation that we observe at different evolutionary
states brings new constraints on the interior models for these stars. We
also derive an updated form of the universal pattern that accounts for
the modulation and provides highly precise radial frequencies.

unprecedented quality for asteroseismology. A very rich oscillation
pattern has been discovered for red giants, including mixed modes that
are used to decipher the red giants interiors. They carry information on
the radiative core of red giant stars and bring strong constraints on
stellar evolution. Since more than 15,000 red giant light curves have
been observed by Kepler, we have developed a simple and efficient method
for automatically characterizing the mixed-mode pattern and measuring
the asymptotic period spacing. With the asymptotic expansion of the
mixed modes, we have revealed the regularity of the gravity-mode
pattern. The stretched periods were used to study the evenly space
periods with a Fourier analysis and to measure the gravity period
spacing, even when rotation severely complicates the oscillation
spectra. We automatically measured gravity period spacing for more than
6,100 Kepler red giants. The results confirm and extend previous
measurements made by semi-automated methods. We also unveil the mass and
metallicity dependence of the relation between the frequency spacings
and the period spacings for stars on the red giant branch. The delivery
of thousands of period spacings combined with all other seismic and
non-seismic information provides a new basis for detailed ensemble
asteroseismology.

that our distances agree very well with those from other methods: the
mean relative difference between our Bayesian distances and those
derived from other methods ranges from -4.2 per cent to +3.6 per cent,
and the dispersion ranges from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. The
extinctions towards all stars are also derived and compared with those
from several other independent methods: the Rayleigh-Jeans Colour Excess

use photometric effective temperatures (T $_{eff}$) and
metallicities ([Fe/H]) as inputs, which are not sufficiently accurate as
suggested by previous studies. We adopted the spectroscopic T
$_{eff}$ and [Fe/H] values based on the Large sky Area
Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) low-resolution

parameters to derive the physical parameters of a large sample of stars.
Clear trends were found between $\{$$\{${$\Delta$}

well as log g, which may result in an overestimation of up to 0.5 dex
for the log g values of giants in the LAMOST catalog. We established
empirical calibration relations for the log g values of dwarfs and
giants. These results can be used for determining the precise distances
to these stars based on their spectroscopic parameters.

key project of SDSS-III, the intrinsic colors of a large number of giant
stars are accurately determined from the stellar effective temperature.
Taking advantage of this and using a sample of 5942 K-type giants, the
NIR extinction law is carefully revisited. The color excess ratio E(J -
H)/E(J - K $_{S}$), representative of the NIR extinction law,
shows no dependence on the color excess when E(J - K $_{S}$)
changes from \~{}0.3 to \~{}4.0, which implies a universal NIR extinction law
from diffuse to dense regions. The constant value of E(J - H)/E(J - K
$_{S}$), 0.64, corresponds to a power law index of 1.95. The other
two ratios, E(H - K $_{S}$)/E(J - K $_{S}$) and E(J - H)/E(H
- K $_{S}$), are 0.36 and 1.78, respectively. The results are
consistent with the MRN dust size distribution.

believed to have formed through disc instability processes. Despite its
proximity, its large-scale properties are still not very well known, due
to our position in the obscuring Galactic disc. Here, we make a
measurement of the three-dimensional density distribution of the
Galactic bulge using red clump giants identified in DR1 of the Vista
Variables in the Via Lactea survey. Our density map covers the inner
(2.2 {\times} 1.4 {\times} 1.1) kpc of the bulge/bar. Line-of-sight
density distributions are estimated by deconvolving extinction- and
completeness-corrected K$_{s}$-band magnitude distributions. In
constructing our measurement, we assume that the three-dimensional bulge
is eightfold mirror triaxially symmetric. In doing so, we measure the
angle of the bar-bulge to the line of sight to be (27 {\plusmn} 2){\deg},
where the dominant error is systematic arising from the details of the
deconvolution process. The resulting density distribution shows a highly
elongated bar with projected axis ratios {\ap}(1 : 2.1) for isophotes
reaching {\tilde}2 kpc along the major axis. Along the bar axes the
density falls off roughly exponentially, with axis ratios (10 : 6.3 :
2.6) and exponential scalelengths (0.70 : 0.44 : 0.18) kpc. From about
400 pc above the Galactic plane, the bulge density distribution displays
a prominent X-structure. Overall, the density distribution of the
Galactic bulge is characteristic for a strongly boxy/peanut-shaped bulge
within a barred galaxy.

extinction from intervening dust is greatest. We investigate here the
Galactic bar outside the bulge, the long bar, using red clump giant
(RCG) stars from United Kingdom Infrared Deep Sky Survey, Two Micron All
Sky Survey, Vista Variables in the Via Lactea and Galactic Legacy
Infrared Midplane Survey Extraordinaire. We match and combine these
surveys to investigate a wide area in latitude and longitude, |b| {\le}
9{\deg} and |l| {\le} 40{\deg}. We find (i) the bar extends to l {\tilde}
25{\deg} at |b| {\tilde} 5{\deg} from the Galactic plane, and to l {\tilde}
30{\deg} at lower latitudes; (ii) the long bar has an angle to the
line-of-sight in the range (28{\deg}-33{\deg}), consistent with studies of
the bulge at |l| $\lt$ 10{\deg}; (iii) the scale height of RCG stars
smoothly transitions from the bulge to the thinner long bar; (iv) there
is evidence for two scale heights in the long bar; we find a {\tilde}180
pc thin bar component reminiscent of the old thin disc near the Sun, and
a {\tilde}45 pc superthin bar components which exist predominantly
towards the bar end; (v) constructing parametric models for the red
clump magnitude distributions, we find a bar half-length of 5.0 {\plusmn}
0.2 kpc for the two-component bar, and 4.6 {\plusmn} 0.3 kpc for the thin
bar component alone. We conclude that the Milky Way contains a central
box/peanut bulge which is the vertical extension of a longer, flatter
bar, similar as seen in both external galaxies and N-body models.

  Abstract                 = {{Low-mass {\ldquo}dwarf{\rdquo} galaxies represent the most significant
challenges to the cold dark matter (CDM) model of cosmological structure
formation. Because these faint galaxies are (best) observed within the
Local Group (LG) of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31),
understanding their formation in such an environment is critical. We
present first results from the Latte Project: the Milky Way on Feedback
in Realistic Environments (FIRE). This simulation models the formation
of an MW-mass galaxy to z=0 within {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology, including dark
matter, gas, and stars at unprecedented resolution: baryon particle mass
of 7070 $\{$M$\}$$_{&sun; }$ with gas kernel/softening that adapts down
to 1 $\{$pc$\}$ (with a median of 25$\{$--$\}$60 $\{$pc$\}$ at z=0). Latte was simulated
using the GIZMO code with a mesh-free method for accurate hydrodynamics
and the FIRE-2 model for star formation and explicit feedback within a
multi-phase interstellar medium. For the first time, Latte
self-consistently resolves the spatial scales corresponding to
half-light radii of dwarf galaxies that form around an MW-mass host down
to $\{$M$\}$$_{{star}$$\}${\gsim} $\{$10$\}$$^{5}$ $\{$M$\}$$_{&sun; }$.
Latte{\rsquo}s population of dwarf galaxies agrees with the LG across a
broad range of properties: (1) distributions of stellar masses and
stellar velocity dispersions (dynamical masses), including their joint
relation; (2) the mass-metallicity relation; and (3) diverse range
of star formation histories, including their mass dependence. Thus,
Latte produces a realistic population of dwarf galaxies at
$\{$M$\}$$_{{star}$$\}${\gsim} $\{$10$\}$$^{5}$ $\{$M$\}$$_{&sun; }$ that
does not suffer from the {\ldquo}missing satellites{\rdquo} or {\ldquo}too
big to fail{\rdquo} problems of small-scale structure formation. We
conclude that baryonic physics can reconcile observed dwarf galaxies
with standard {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology.

dramatic increase in the number of main-sequence and subgiant stars with
detected solar-like oscillations. We present an ensemble asteroseismic
analysis of 76 solar-type stars. Using frequencies determined from the
Kepler time-series photometry, we have measured three asteroseismic
parameters that characterize the oscillations: the large frequency
separation ({$\Delta$}{$\nu$}), the small frequency separation between modes
of l = 0 and l = 2 ({$\delta$}{$\nu$}$_{02}$), and the dimensionless
offset (epsilon). These measurements allow us to construct asteroseismic
diagrams, namely the so-called Christensen-Dalsgaard diagram of
{$\delta$}{$\nu$}$_{02}$ versus {$\Delta$}{$\nu$}, and the recently
re-introduced epsilon diagram. We compare the Kepler results with
previously observed solar-type stars and with theoretical models. The
positions of stars in these diagrams places constraints on their masses
and ages. Additionally, we confirm the observational relationship
between epsilon and T $_{eff}$ that allows for the unambiguous
determination of radial order and should help resolve the problem of
mode identification in F stars.

with detected solar-like oscillations has increased by several orders of
magnitude; for the first time we are able to perform large-scale
ensemble asteroseismology of these stars. In preparation for this golden
age of asteroseismology we have computed expected values of various
asteroseismic observables from models of varying mass and metallicity.
The relationships between these asteroseismic observables, such as the
separations between mode frequencies, are able to significantly
constrain estimates of the ages and masses of these stars. We
investigate the scaling relation between the large frequency separation,
{$\Delta$}{$\nu$}, and mean stellar density. Furthermore we present model
evolutionary tracks for several asteroseismic diagrams. We have extended
the so-called C-D diagram beyond the main sequence to the subgiants and
the red giant branch. We also consider another asteroseismic diagram,
the epsilon diagram, which is more sensitive to variations in stellar
properties at the subgiant stages and can aid in determining the correct
mode identification. The recent discovery of gravity-mode period
spacings in red giants forms the basis for a third asteroseismic
diagram. We compare the evolutionary model tracks in these asteroseismic
diagrams with results from pre-Kepler studies of solar-like oscillations
and early results from Kepler.

  Abstract                 = {{Bayesian methods are becoming more widely used in asteroseismic
analysis. In particular, they are being used to determine oscillation
frequencies, which are also commonly found by Fourier analysis. It is
important to establish whether the Bayesian methods provide an
improvement on Fourier methods. We compare, using simulated data, the
standard iterative sine-wave fitting method against a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) code that has been introduced to infer purely the
frequencies of oscillation modes (Brewer et al. 2007). A uniform prior
probability distribution function is used for the MCMC method. We find
the methods do equally well at determining the correct oscillation
frequencies, although the Bayesian method is able to highlight the
possibility of a misidentification due to aliasing, which can be useful.
In general, we suggest that the least computationally intensive method
is preferable.

differences. Simple parametric fits to the (R, Z) trends for
V$_{phi}$ and the velocity dispersions are presented. We
confirm the recently discovered gradient in mean Galactocentric radial
velocity, V$_{R}$, finding that the gradient is marked below the
plane ({$\delta$}{\lt}V$_{R}${\gt}/{$\delta$}R = -8 km s$^{-1}$
kpc$^{-1}$ for Z {\lt} 0, vanishing to zero above the plane), with
a Z gradient thus also present. The vertical velocity, V$_{Z}$,
also shows clear, large-amplitude (|V$_{Z}$| = 17 km
s$^{-1}$) structure, with indications of a rarefaction-compression
pattern, suggestive of wave-like behaviour. We perform a rigorous error
analysis, tracing sources of both systematic and random errors. We
confirm the north-south differences in V$_{R}$ and V$_{Z}$
along the line of sight, with the V$_{R}$ estimated independent of
the proper motions. The complex three-dimensional structure of velocity
space presents challenges for future modelling of the Galactic disc,
with the Galactic bar, spiral arms and excitation of wave-like
structures all probably playing a role.

underlying population, which we assume represents all stars which could
have potentially been observed. We evaluate the completeness fraction as
a function of position, magnitude, and color in two ways: first, on a
field-by-field basis, and second, in equal-size areas on the sky. Then,
we consider the effect of the RAVE stellar parameter pipeline on the
final resulting catalogue, which in principle limits the parameter space
over which our selection function is valid. Our final selection function
is the product of the completeness fraction and the selection function
of the pipeline. We then test if the application of the selection
function introduces biases in the derived parameters. To do this, we
compare a parent mock catalogue generated using Galaxia with a mock-RAVE
catalogue where the selection function of RAVE has been applied. We
conclude that for stars brighter than I = 12, between $4000 \rm K \lt
T\_{\rm eff} \lt 8000 \rm K$ and $0.5 \lt \rm{log}\,g \lt 5.0$, RAVE
is kinematically and chemically unbiased with respect to expectations
from Galaxia.

chemically separated, kinematically distinct disc components in the
solar neighbourhood. We apply probabilistic chemical selection criteria
to separate our sample into {$\alpha$}-low (`thin disc') and {$\alpha$}-high
(`thick disc') sequences. Using newly derived distances, which will be
utilized in the upcoming RAVE DR5, we explore the kinematic trends as a
function of metallicity for each of the disc components. For our
{$\alpha$}-low disc, we find a negative trend in the mean rotational
velocity (V$_{phi}$) as a function of iron abundance ([Fe/H]).
We measure a positive gradient {\part}V$_{phi}$/{\part}[Fe/H] for
the {$\alpha$}-high disc, consistent with results from high-resolution
surveys. We also find differences between the {$\alpha$}-low and
{$\alpha$}-high discs in all three components of velocity dispersion. We
discuss the implications of an {$\alpha$}-low, metal-rich population
originating from the inner Galaxy, where the orbits of these stars have
been significantly altered by radial mixing mechanisms in order to bring
them into the solar neighbourhood. The probabilistic separation we
propose can be extended to other data sets for which the accuracy in
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] is not sufficient to disentangle the chemical disc
components a priori. For such data sets which will also have significant
overlap with Gaia DR1, we can therefore make full use of the improved
parallax and proper motion data as it becomes available to investigate
kinematic trends in these chemical disc components.

stars of 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25, 30, 35, and 40
M$_{sun}$ and metallicities Z = 0, l0$^{-4}$, 0.01, 0.1, and
1 times solar (a slightly reduced mass grid is employed for nonsolar
metallicities). Altogether 78 different model supernova explosions are
calculated. In each case nucleosynthesis has already been determined for
200 isotopes in each of 600 to 1200 zones of the presupernova star,
including the effects of time dependent convection. Here each star is
exploded using a piston to give a specified final kinetic energy at
infinity (typically 1.2 {\times} 10$^{51}$ ergs), and the explosive
modifications to the nucleosynthesis, including the effects of neutrino
irradiation, determined. A single value of the critical
$^{12}$C({$\alpha$},{$\gamma$}) $^{16}$O reaction rate
corresponding to 8(300 keV) = 170 keV barns is used in all calculations.
The synthesis of each isotope is discussed along with its sensitivity to
model parameters. In each case, the final mass of the collapsed remnant
is also determined and often found not to correspond to the location of
the piston (typically the edge of the iron core), but to a ''mass cut''
farther out. This mass cut is sensitive not only to the explosion
energy, but also to the presupernova structure, stellar mass, and the
metallicity. Unless the explosion mechanism, for unknown reasons,
provides a much larger characteristic energy in more massive stars, it
appears likely that stars larger than about 30 M$_{sun}$ will
experience considerable reimplosion of heavy elements following the
initial launch of a successful shock. While such explosions will
produce a viable, bright Type II supernova light curve, lacking perhaps
the radioactive tail, they will have dramatically reduced yields of
heavy elements and may leave black hole remnants of up to 10 and more
solar masses. The production of black holes may be particularly favored
for stars of low metallicity, both because of their more compact
structure and reduced mass loss.

selected from the LAMOST Galactic survey to study the evolution of the
Galaxy, and it is vital to derive accurate stellar parameters. In this
work, we select 150 MSTO star candidates from the MSTO star sample of
Xiang that have asteroseismic parameters and determine accurate stellar
parameters for these stars by combining asteroseismic parameters deduced
from Kepler photometry and atmospheric parameters deduced from LAMOST
spectra. With this sample, we examine the age determination as well as
the contamination rate of the MSTO star sample. A comparison of age
between this work and Xiang shows a mean difference of 0.53 Gyr (7\%) and
a dispersion of 2.71 Gyr (28\%). The results show that 79 of the
candidates are MSTO stars, while the others are contaminations from
either main sequence or sub-giant stars. The contamination rate for the
oldest stars is much higher than that for younger stars. The main cause
for the high contamination rate is found to be the relatively large
systematic bias in the LAMOST surface gravity estimates.

abundances is crucial for Galactic archaeology via large-scale
spectroscopic surveys. In this paper, we estimate stellar atmospheric
parameters - effective temperature T$_{eff}$, surface gravity log
g and metallicity [Fe/H], absolute magnitudes M$_{V}$ and
M$_{Ks}$, {$\alpha$}-element to metal (and iron) abundance ratio
[{$\alpha$}/M] (and [{$\alpha$}/Fe]), as well as carbon and nitrogen
abundances [C/H] and [N/H] from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre
Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) spectra with a multivariate regression
method based on kernel-based principal component analysis, using stars
in common with other surveys (Hipparcos, Kepler, Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment) as training data sets. Both
internal and external examinations indicate that given a spectral
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) better than 50, our method is capable of
delivering stellar parameters with a precision of {\tilde}100 K for
T$_{eff}$, {\tilde}0.1 dex for log g, 0.3-0.4 mag for M$_{V}$
and M$_{Ks}$, 0.1 dex for [Fe/H], [C/H] and [N/H], and better than
0.05 dex for [{$\alpha$}/M] ([{$\alpha$}/Fe]). The results are satisfactory
even for a spectral SNR of 20. The work presents first determinations of
[C/H] and [N/H] abundances from a vast data set of LAMOST, and, to our
knowledge, the first reported implementation of absolute magnitude
estimation directly based on a vast data set of observed spectra. The
derived stellar parameters for millions of stars from the LAMOST surveys
will be publicly available in the form of value-added catalogues.

  Abstract                 = {{Accurate measurements of stellar metallicity gradients in the radial and
vertical directions of the disk and their temporal variations provide
important constraints on the formation and evolution of the Milky Way
disk. We use 297 042 main sequence turn-off stars selected from the
LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey of the Galactic Anti-center (LSS-GAC) to
determine the radial and vertical gradients of stellar metallicity,
{$\Delta$}[Fe/H]/{$\Delta$}R and {$\Delta$}[Fe/H]/{$\Delta$}|Z| of the Milky Way
disk in the direction of the anticenter. We determine ages of those
turn-off stars by isochrone fitting and measure the temporal variations
of metallicity gradients. We have carried out a detailed analysis of the
selection effects resulting from the selection, observation and data
reduction of LSS-GAC targets and the potential biases of a magnitude
limited sample on the determinations of metallicity gradients. Our
results show that the gradients, both in the radial and vertical
directions, exhibit significant spatial and temporal variations. The
radial gradients yielded by stars with the oldest ages ({\gsim} 11 Gyr)
are essentially zero at all heights from the disk midplane, while those
given by younger stars are always negative. The vertical gradients
deduced from stars with the oldest ages ({\gsim} 11 Gyr) are negative and
only show very weak variations with Galactocentric distance in the disk
plane, R, while those yielded by younger stars show strong variations
with R. After being essentially flat at the earliest epochs of disk
formation, the radial gradients steepen as age decreases, reaching a
maximum (steepest) at age 7-8 Gyr, and then they flatten again.
Similar temporal trends are also found for the vertical gradients. We
infer that the assembly of the Milky Way disk may have experienced at
least two distinct phases. The earlier phase is probably related to a
slow, pressure-supported collapse of gas, when the gas settles down to
the disk mainly in the vertical direction. In the later phase, there are
significant radial flows of gas in the disk, and the rate of gas inflow
near the solar neighborhood reaches a maximum around a lookback time of
7-8 Gyr. The transition between the two phases occurs around a
lookback time between 8 and 11 Gyr. The two phases may be responsible
for the formation of the Milky Way's thick and thin disks, respectively.
Also, as a consequence, we recommend that stellar age is a natural,
physical criterion to distinguish stars from the thin and thick disks.
From an epoch earlier than 11Gyr to one between 8 and 11Gyr, there is an
abrupt, significant change in magnitude of both the radial and vertical
metallicity gradients, suggesting that stellar radial migration is
unlikely to play an important role in the formation of the thick disk.

[{$\alpha$}/Fe] ([{$\alpha$}/M]), elemental abundances [C/H] and [N/H], and
absolute magnitudes M$_{V}$ and M\_$\{$K\_s$\}$ deduced from 1.8 million
spectra of 1.4 million unique stars targeted by the LSS-GAC since
September 2011 until June 2014. The catalogues also give values of
interstellar reddening, distance and orbital parameters determined with
a variety of techniques, as well as proper motions and multi-band
photometry from the far-UV to the mid-IR collected from the literature
and various surveys. Accuracies of radial velocities reach 5 km
s$^{-1}$ for late-type stars, and those of distance estimates
range between 10 - 30 per cent, depending on the spectral
signal-to-noise ratios. Precisions of [Fe/H], [C/H] and [N/H] estimates
reach 0.1 dex, and those of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [{$\alpha$}/M] reach 0.05 dex.
The large number of stars, the contiguous sky coverage, the simple yet
non-trivial target selection function and the robust estimates of
stellar radial velocities and atmospheric parameters, distances and
elemental abundances, make the catalogues a valuable data set to study
the structure and evolution of the Galaxy, especially the
solar-neighbourhood and the outer disk.

giants is calibrated to the RR Lyrae distance scale. The absolute
magnitude of the K/M-giant stars at the tip of the giant branch is
M\_$\{$g\_0$\}$=-1.0. The line-of-sight velocities of the M giant and blue
horizontal-branch (BHB) stars that are spatially coincident with the Sgr

reinforcing the need for new models that can explain all of the Sgr
tidal debris stream observations. We estimate stellar densities along
the tidal tails that can be used to help constrain future models. The
K/M giant, BHB, and F-turnoff stars in the lower surface brightness
tidal stream that is adjacent to the main leading Sgr dwarf tidal tail
have velocities and metallicities that are similar to those of the stars
in the leading tidal tail. The ratio of K/M giants to BHBs and BHBs to
F-turnoff stars are also similar for both branches of the leading tidal
tail. We show that there is an additional low-metallicity tidal stream
near the Sgr trailing tidal tail.

  Abstract                 = {{We measure chemical abundance ratios and radial velocities in four
massive (i.e., young) [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich red giant stars using
high-resolution high-S/N spectra from ESPaDOnS fed by Gemini-GRACES. Our
differential analysis ensures that our chemical abundances are on the
same scale as the Alves-Brito et al. (2010) study of bulge, thin and
thick disk red giants. We confirm that the program stars have enhanced
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios and are slightly metal poor. Aside from lithium
enrichment in one object, the program stars exhibit no chemical
abundance anomalies when compared to giant stars of similar metallicity
throughout the Galaxy. This includes the elements Li, O, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr,
Ni, Cu, Ba, La, and Eu. Therefore, there are no obvious chemical
signatures that can help to reveal the origin of these unusual stars.
While our new observations show that only one star (not the Li-rich
object) exhibits a radial velocity variation, simulations indicate that
we cannot exclude the possibility that all four could be binaries. In
addition, we find that two (possibly three) stars show evidence for an
infrared excess, indicative of a debris disk. This is consistent with
these young [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich stars being evolved blue stragglers,
suggesting their apparent young age is a consequence of a merger or mass
transfer. We would expect a binary fraction of {\tilde}50\% or greater for
the entire sample of these stars, but the signs of the circumbinary disk
may have been lost since these features can have short timescales.
Radial velocity monitoring is needed to confirm the blue straggler

sight for both disk- and halo-population stars with three-color
photometry. The observed star counts as a function of visual magnitude
and color are synthesized by an integral equation, where the luminosity
function is assumed to be that of van Rhijn for the disk stars and that
of globular clusters M92 and M3 for the field halo stars, respectively.
Adopting the conventional exponential density law for both disk and halo
stars, we derive the density gradient d log D(z)/dz (z in kpc) toward
the north galactic pole. The density gradient is almost uniquely
determined to be -1.4 for the disk stars and -0.2 for the halo stars
with the halo density outnumbering the disk beyond z{\ge}2 kpc. The halo
mass density is estimated to be (3-5) {\times} 1O$^{-4}$
M$_{sun}$ pc$^{-3}$ in the solar neighborhood.

obtained, and the UCAC5 catalog of mean positions at a mean epoch near
2001 was generated. By combining UCAC5 with Gaia DR1 data, new proper
motions were obtained for over 107 million stars on the Gaia coordinate
system, with typical accuracies of 1{\ndash}2 mas yr$^{-1}$
(R = 11{\ndash}15 mag) and about 5 mas yr$^{-1}$ at 16th mag.
Proper motions of most TGAS stars are improved over their Gaia data and
the precision level of TGAS proper motions is extended to many millions
more, fainter stars. External comparisons were made using stellar
cluster fields and extragalactic sources. The TGAS data allow us to
derive the limiting precision of the UCAC x, y data, which is
significantly better than1/100 pixel.

partial differential equation which governs the transport of angular
momentum is derived. Both the meridian circulation and the turbulence
are determined by the loss of angular momentum, which is ascribed solely
to a stellar wind. When there is no wind, the meridian flow is very
weak, and it can even vanish in slow rotators. When the wind is active,
it drives the circulation in order to transport angular momentum to the
surface, but the advection of chemical species by this flow is partly
inhibited because of the horizontal turbulence. It is concluded that,
since the old population II stars are slow rotators, they do not display
at their surface the original abundance of lithium.

them to the analysis of the observed H-band spectra of the Sun and the
K2 giant Arcturus, as well as to a selected sample of well-known giant

maps of the skewness and kurtosis of the LOSVDs of metal-rich and
metal-poor inner MW stars (divided at [Fe/H] = -0.4), and
comparing the observed patterns to those that are seen both in N-body
models and in extragalactic bars. Despite closely matching the mean
velocity and dispersion, the models do not reproduce the observed
skewness patterns of the LOSVDs in different ways, which demonstrates
that our understanding of the detailed orbital structure of the inner MW
remains an important regime for improvement. We find evidence in the MW
of the skewness-velocity correlation that is used as a diagnostic
of extragalactic bars/bulges. This correlation appears in metal-rich
stars only, providing further evidence for different evolutionary
histories of chemically differentiated populations. We connect these
skewness measurements to previous work on high-velocity
{\ldquo}peaks{\rdquo} in the inner Galaxy, confirming the presence of that
phenomenon, and we quantify the cylindrical rotation of the inner
Galaxy, finding that the latitude-independent rotation vanishes outside
l {\tilde} 7{\deg}. Finally, we evaluate the MW data in the light of
selected extragalactic bar diagnostics and discuss the progress and
challenges in using the MW as a resolved analog of unresolved stellar
populations.

Chinese national scientific research facility operated by National
Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC). After
two years of commissioning beginning in 2009, the telescope,
instruments, software systems and operations are nearly ready to begin
the main science survey. Through a spectral survey of millions of
objects in much of the northern sky, LAMOST will enable research in a
number of contemporary cutting edge topics in astrophysics, such as
discovery of the first generation stars in the Galaxy, pinning down the
formation and evolution history of galaxies {\mdash} especially the Milky
Way and its central massive black hole, and looking for signatures of
the distribution of dark matter and possible sub-structures in the Milky
Way halo. To maximize the scientific potential of the facility, wide
national participation and international collaboration have been
emphasized. The survey has two major components: the LAMOST
ExtraGAlactic Survey (LEGAS) and the LAMOST Experiment for Galactic
Understanding and Exploration (LEGUE). Until LAMOST reaches its full
capability, the LEGUE portion of the survey will use the available
observing time, starting in 2012. An overview of the LAMOST project and
the survey that will be carried out in the next five to six years is
presented in this paper. The science plan for the whole LEGUE survey,
instrumental specifications, site conditions, and the descriptions of
the current on-going pilot survey, including its footprints and target
selection algorithm, will be presented as separate papers in this
volume.

  Abstract                 = {{Context. The Galactic bulge is a massive, old component of the Milky
Way. It is known to host a bar, and it has recently been demonstrated to
have a pronounced boxy/peanut structure in its outer region. Several
independent studies suggest the presence of more than one stellar
populations in the bulge, with different origins and a relative fraction
changing across the bulge area. <BR /> Aims: This is the first of a
series of papers presenting the results of the Giraffe Inner Bulge
Survey, carried out at the ESO-VLT with the multifibre spectrograph
FLAMES. Spectra of \~{}5000 red clump giants in 24 bulge fields have been
obtained at resolution R = 6500, in the infrared Calcium triplet
wavelength region at \~{}8500 {\AA}. They are used to derive radial
velocities and metallicities, based on new calibration specifically
devised for this project. Radial velocities for another \~{}1200 bulge red
clump giants, obtained from similar archive data, have been added to the
sample. Higher resolution spectra have been obtained for \~{}450 additional
stars at latitude b = -3.5, with the aim of investigating chemical
abundance patterns variations with longitude, across the inner bulge. In
total we present here radial velocities for 6392 red clump stars. <BR />
Methods: We present here the target selection criteria, observing
strategy and the catalog with radial velocity measurements for all the
target stars. <BR /> Results: We derive a radial velocity, and velocity
dispersion map of the Milky Way bulge, useful to be compared with
similar maps of external bulges, and to infer the expected velocities
and dispersion at any line of sight. The K-type giants kinematics is
consistent with the cylindrical rotation pattern of M-giants from the
BRAVA survey. Our sample enables to extend this result to latitude b =
-2, closer to the Galactic plane than probed by previous surveys.
Finally, we find strong evidence for a velocity dispersion peak at (0,
-1) and (0, -2), possibily indicative of a high density peak in the
central \~{}250 pc of the bulge.

  Abstract                 = {{We present a new determination of the metallicity distribution, age, and
luminosity function of the Galactic bulge stellar population. By
combining near-IR data from the 2MASS survey, from the SOFI imager at
ESO NTT and the NICMOS camera on board HST we were able to construct
color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) and luminosity functions (LF) with large
statistics and small photometric errors from the Asymptotic Giant Branch
(AGB) and Red Giant Branch (RGB) tip down to \~{} 0.15 M$_{sun}$.
This is the most extended and complete LF so far obtained for the
galactic bulge. Similar near-IR data for a disk control field were used
to decontaminate the bulge CMDs from foreground disk stars, and hence to
set a stronger constraint on the bulge age, which we found to be as
large as that of Galactic globular clusters, or ga 10 Gyr. No trace is
found for any younger stellar population. Synthetic CMDs have been
constructed to simulate the effect of photometric errors, blending,
differential reddening, metallicity dispersion and depth effect in the
comparison with the observational data. By combining the near-IR data
with optical ones, from the Wide Field Imager at the ESO/MPG 2.2 m
telescope, a disk-decontaminated (M$_{K}$,V-K) CMD has been
constructed and used to derive the bulge metallicity distribution, by
comparison with empirical RGB templates. The bulge metallicity is found
to peak at near solar value, with a sharp cutoff just above solar, and a
tail towards lower metallicity that does not appreciably extend below
[M/H] \~{} -1.5.

Silla, Chile, obtained from the ESO/ST-ECF Science Archive Facility, and

innermost region. A thinner and longer structure departing from the main
bar has also been found, although the observational evidences that
support the scenario of two separate structures has been recently
challenged. Metal poor stars ([Fe/H]$\lesssim -0.5$ dex) trace a
different structure, and also have different kinematics.

two components with different mean metallicities, and possibly different
spatial distribution and kinematics. As a consequence, both the
metallicity distribution and the radial velocity of bulge stars vary
across different line of sights. We present here the metallicity
distribution function of red clump stars in 26 fields spread across a
wide area of the bulge, with special emphasis on fields close to
Galactic plane, at latitudes b=-2 and b=-1, that were not explored
before. This paper includes new metallicities from a sample of about
5000 K giant stars, observed at spectral resolution R=6500, in the
Calcium II Triplet region. They are the main dataset of the GIRAFFE
Inner Bulge Survey. As part of the same survey we have previously
published results for a sample of about 600 K giant stars, at latitude
b=-4 , derived from higher resolution spectra (R=22,500). Results. The
combined sample allows us to trace and characterize the metal poor and
metal rich bulge populations down to the inner bulge. We present a
density map for each of the two components. Contrary to the expectations
from previous works, we found the metal poor population to be more
centrally concentrated than the metal rich one, and with a more
axisymmetric spatial distribution. The metal rich population, on the
other hand, is arranged in a boxy distribution, consistent with an
edge-on bar. By coupling metallicities and radial velocities we show
that the metal poor population has a velocity dispersion that varies
rather mildly with latitude. On the contrary, the metal rich population
has a low velocity dispersion far from the plane (b=-8.5), but it has a
steeper gradient with latitude, becoming higher than the metal poor one
in the innermost field (b=-1). [abridged]

  Abstract                 = {{We present the second data release of the Radial Velocity Experiment
(RAVE), an ambitious spectroscopic survey to measure radial velocities
and stellar atmosphere parameters (temperature, metallicity, surface
gravity, and rotational velocity) of up to one million stars using the 6
dF multi-object spectrograph on the 1.2 m UK Schmidt Telescope of the
Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO). The RAVE program started in 2003,
obtaining medium resolution spectra (median R = 7500) in the Ca-triplet
region (8410-8795 {\AA}) for southern hemisphere stars drawn from the
Tycho-2 and SuperCOSMOS catalogues, in the magnitude range 9 $\lt$ I $\lt$
12. Following the first data release, the current release doubles the
sample of published radial velocities, now containing 51,829 radial
velocities for 49,327 individual stars observed on 141 nights between
2003 April 11 and 2005 March 31. Comparison with external data sets
shows that the new data collected since 2004 April 3 show a standard
deviation of 1.3 km s$^{-1}$, about twice as good as for the first
data release. For the first time, this data release contains values of
stellar parameters from 22,407 spectra of 21,121 individual stars. They
were derived by a penalized {$\chi$}$^{2}$ method using an extensive
grid of synthetic spectra calculated from the latest version of Kurucz
stellar atmosphere models. From comparison with external data sets, our
conservative estimates of errors of the stellar parameters for a
spectrum with an average signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of \~{}40 are 400 K in
temperature, 0.5 dex in gravity, and 0.2 dex in metallicity. We note
however that, for all three stellar parameters, the internal errors
estimated from repeat RAVE observations of 855 stars are at least a
factor 2 smaller. We demonstrate that the results show no systematic
offsets if compared to values derived from photometry or complementary
spectroscopic analyses. The data release includes proper motions from
Starnet2, Tycho-2, and UCAC2 catalogs and photometric measurements from
Tycho-2 USNO-B, DENIS, and 2MASS. The data release can be accessed via
the RAVE Web site: http://www.rave-survey.org and through CDS.
